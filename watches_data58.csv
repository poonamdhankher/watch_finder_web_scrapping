                            The Engineer Hydrocarbon is perhaps Ball's most impressive watch collection, at least in terms of cutting-edge technology and imposing designs. These timepieces are big, practical and good looking, and their engineering is as exquisite as any of the brand's watches. Ball has created several brilliant Hydrocarbons over the years, but arguably none quite as remarkable as the Spacemaster. This model is known for its incredible tritium micro gas tubes on the dial and hands that create a distinctive glow (in a range of colours) for increased ease of reading at night. The gas maintains its extraordinary luminescence for at least 25 years, and does not dim at night, unlike modern luminous paint. The watch also features a detailed engraving of an astronaut on the caseback.

                            The Maurice Lacroix Masterpiece collection was the company's first line of beautiful, high-end watches that used mechanical movements founded on the best Swiss traditions. In 2006, it also became the first collection to use its in-house manufacture movements, propelling the brand into the upper echelons of haute horlogerie. With its position as one of the finest boutique watchmakers in the industry now firmly secured, Maurice Lacroix has gone from strength to strength, and this piece is a magnificent example. Also using an in-house movement, the watch has been skeletonised to stunning effect. The “Squelette”, as it's called, uses the finest hand-crafted traditional workmanship to create a watch with a modern, innovative spirit.
