                            This masterful Luminor 1950 from Panerai features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph (also known as a rattrapante), one of high-end watchmaking's most challenging mechanical complications to manufacture. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden; an extra pusher at 8 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other hand continues to run. The PAM 213 uses the OP XVIII movement, based on a stunning and unusual column wheel Valjoux 7750.

                            The modern Luminor design originated in the early 1950s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. Three limited edition pieces created at this time set the style for what would soon become Luminor. It somewhat updated the look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, and continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950’s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its black carbide titanium case, red highlights and ceramic bezel. The watch uses TAG's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features a modern version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

The design is built to recall the deck watches of the 1930s and 1940s, referencing IWC's history in pilot's watches.  This impressive watch also features an elaborate Top Gun engraving, stunning anthracite dial and an extra lightweight ceramic and titanium case made with zirconium oxide fired at temperatures approaching 2,000 degrees centigrade. The in-house calibre 51111 has a seven day power reserve, and the watch comes with a military style green textile strap.

                            The Grand Lange 1 is, as the name suggests, a larger version of the Lange 1, which was one of the four new watches the German brand presented when it was revived in 1994 after decades of dormancy. The company has gone on to be the flagbearer for fine, traditional watchmaking in the east German town of Glashütte. At 41mm it is significantly larger than the 37mm Lange 1 and features a moonphase display within the main sub-dial, while elsewhere can be found a big date display, power reserve indicator and small seconds, all harmoniously positioned within the asymmetrical silver dial. Like the Lange 1, it’s powered by a manual-wind movement seen through display caseback, revealing Glashutte stripes and intricate engraving. The date for months that don’t run to 31 days is corrected via a button on the side of the yellow-gold case and the power reserve is three days.

                            The Grand Prix de Monaco is one of the most iconic events in all of motor racing. Held since 1929, the race takes place on the streets of the city—challenging for drivers and exhilarating for spectators. Just as the event was updated in the late 90s to become the “Grand Prix de Monaco Historique”, so have Chopard's exceptional racing watches that commemorate it. The Monaco Historique collection, launched in 2014, marks a turning point for the Grand Prix watches. They are no longer simply a bunch of coveted and collectible Limited Editions, but now have a magnificently good-looking permanent backbone on which to build. This beauty in steel showcases all of the Monaco Historique's best qualities.

                            On the surface, the PAM 141 seems like a relatively typical example of Panerai's iconic Radiomir series, with its big cushion cases, glorious onion crown and leather strap – the same look that has been doing wonders for the brand ever since it started out making watches for the Italian Navy back in the 1930s. But flip this watch over and the stunning view through the sapphire crystal caseback will reveal something you won't see in many other Radiomirs: the 141 is powered by the OP VII, based on the famous Elite movement by fellow Swiss horological giant, Zenith. In fact, it's none other than the Elite 680, a prestigious ultra-thin calibre beating at 28,000 vph. Because of this, the PAM 141 is highly sought-after, particularly as it's thought that only 500 were ever made.
