                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 divers conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its unidirectional bezel, exceptionally legible design and superb finishing and craftsmanship. The piece maintains an excellent 300 meter water resistance, protecting the TAG Heuer Calibre 5 inside.

                            The Luminor design originated in the early 1950s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian marketâ€”though it remained firmly rooted in the look and feel of the military watches of the '30s and '40s when the company was born. The new watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. The 44mm PAM 312 is particularly attractive thanks to its use of the stunning P.9000 movement, made in-house by Panerai, with a power reserve of 3 days.
