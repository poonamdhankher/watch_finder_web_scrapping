                            Known as one of the foremost purveyors of ultra-elegant jewellery, Cartier has long held a reputation for superb watches, mostly with excellent mechanical pedigree, but its principal strong suit has been high-fashion and style. The Calibre de Cartier collection represents a big step forward for the brand into the world of true haute horlogerie. Without losing an ounce of its customary sophistication and stylishness, the watches are equipped with the first self-winding movement entirely manufactured by Cartier SA: the glorious 1904 MC (named for the year that Louis Cartier famously made a wristwatch for pilot Alberto Santos-Dumont).

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. The watch builds on the heritage of the legendary Explorer I, which has always been a firm favourite among enthusiasts—the watch was first established in the public mind after its pioneering ascent of Everest during the expedition of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Today the Explorer II deviates in some ways from the original look, but it continues to represent an exceptional, hardy, modernised tool watch with a top-of-the-range in-house movement and a design that does justice to its legacy in both sports and adventure.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. The watch builds on the heritage of the legendary Explorer I, which has always been a firm favourite among enthusiasts—the watch was first established in the public mind after its pioneering ascent of Everest during the expedition of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Today the Explorer II deviates in some ways from the original look, but it continues to represent an exceptional, hardy, modernised tool watch with a top-of-the-range in-house movement and a design that does justice to its legacy in both sports and adventure.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors.

Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication.

                            Introduced in 2013, the Blackbird is a seriously good looking update for Breitling's Avenger series, and a welcome new member of the brand's growing compendium of awesome “stealth” (black-on-black) pieces. The watch may be a reference to the equally cool, black and stealthy SR-71 Blackbird – a legendary US Air Force reconnaissance plane that played a key part in the Cold War. With its carbon-treated titanium case and comparatively slim profile, this Blackbird is as ergonomic and lightweight as its namesake. The dial is super legible and glare-proof, while the movement is based on a premium Swiss chronometer.
