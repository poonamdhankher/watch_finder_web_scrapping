                            The Air King was named in honour of the brave RAF pilots of WWII, when Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, discovered they were ditching their standard issue watches for his Oyster Perpetual. As one of its longest continuously manufactured and most affordable watches, the Air King is a beloved staple of Rolex's range. At Baselworld 2016, the brand released this superbly updated model. It refreshes the classic look, upgrading size, durability and calibre precision while staying true to its aviation heritage in such key elements as the iconic 1950s Air-King font. Many believe that the dial design is inspired by the custom dashboard timepieces Rolex supplied to the Bloodhound SSC land speed record attempt.

                            Originally introduced in 1956, the Day-Date was the first watch to indicate the day of the week spelt out in full when it was launched, making it an innovative piece. In 2008, Rolex released the Day-Date II, a modern update of the timelessly classic Day-Date, which features a larger case than the original watch. However, this has since been replaced by the Day-Date 40, introduced back in 2015. This Day-Date II, then, features a rose gold bracelet, fluted bezel and case, both effortlessly paired with the black baton dial that features baguette-cut diamond and ruby hour markers. This piece is perfect for those after a little bling, or with a taste for rare and discontinued Rolex models.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This incredible 40mm model in 18k Everose gold features a spellbinding sunburst dial that stands out beautifully within the black bezel. Presented on a black rubber Oysterflex bracelet, this is a spectacular timepiece that is currently one of the most sought-after watches around.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            The Rolex Explorer is one of the most highly valued and sought out models for buyers with a lot of experience in the often complicated world of vintage watch collecting. Originally based on the model worn by Tenzing Norgay in the first ever successful ascent of Everest in 1953, the Explorer was a versatile timepiece that enjoyed numerous variations. This reference 14270 is an excellent example. Starting in 1989, it brought a well-received modern upgrade to the Explorer family, while staying faithful to the original model—and also introduced the superb calibre 3000.

                            Like many of its iconic watch families, Rolex's Milgauss was created in 1956 with a specific market in mind: scientists, power station workers and anyone else exposed to high magnetic fields. It was designed to be able to resist fields up to 1,000 gauss (hence the name—“mille” is Latin for thousand). The watch built a solid reputation with only two models until 1988, and was happily revived two decades later in a modern re-edition that remains faithful to the original purpose and aesthetics—including the beloved lightning bolt hand. This gorgeous GV version (Glace Verte) has a green-tinted dial crystal, and uses a Parachrom-Blu hairspring for even better magnetic and shock resistance.

                            Having a date indicator on a watch is taken for granted these days, but before 1945, the concept didn't exist at all—until Rolex added a simple, yet game-changing element to their famous Oyster watch: the date window. This small aperture changed the role of wristwatches from mere timekeeping devices to calendars as well. The Datejust was (and is) known for its classic elegance—the watch is striking in its magnificent, minimalist beauty. This delightful 'mid-size' model, which comes in a variety of dial colours and materials, is intended for use by both men and women.

                            The Seamaster is one of the most iconic diving watches of all time. Following Omega's Marine in 1932, the world's first commercially available diving watch, the legend of the Seamaster officially debuted in 1948. By the time of 1957's 300M, it was among the most dependable and professionally sought dive watches from any brand, and it soon pioneered some of the sporty must-have features we associate with such watches, including unidirectional bezels, phosphorescent hands and the helium escape valve. This excellent example takes the familiar technical specs and design cues and updates them with a stunning chronograph dial featuring sporty red highlights.

                            This exceptional limited edition Panerai honours the incredible, record-setting expedition by legendary South African explorer Mike Horn to the North Pole in 2006. It was the first time anyone had reached the pole without dogs or motorised transport; they went on skis or foot in total darkness for 60 days. This watch, which boasts the expedition's route map and Horn's signature engraved on the caseback, is a very special Luminor. It uses an advanced type of lubricant to prevent it freezing up in arctic conditions, and also features inner protection made of soft iron to make it resistant to magnetic fields. Add in the compass bezel, and you've got the perfect watch for any true adventurer.

                            This is a rare opportunity to own a truly remarkable version of the iconic Rolex Submariner. The LB (“lunette bleu”) watch features a dazzling blue bezel and dial on top of all that lovely Rolex design and prestige—and best of all, it comes in a gorgeous white gold case. The Submariner is one of the greatest legends in the world of watches, perhaps ever. Developed with Jacques-Yves Cousteau in 1953, it quickly became the quintessential diver's watch, a reputation only cemented by appearances in the early Bond films. Today, its timeless design and unbeatable mechanical pedigree continue to make it one of the brand's best-selling pieces.

                            In 2008, Rolex released the Day-Date II, a modern update of the timelessly classic Day-Date, which features a larger case (41mm) than the original. This in turn was replaced in 2015 by the Day-Date 40 which, as the name implies, comes in a 40mm case. This version in white gold features a signature fluted bezel, within which is a sublime dark green dial bearing applied Roman numerals. The date at 3 o’clock lies beneath the signature Rolex Cyclops magnifying lens for better legibility. It comes on a President bracelet and runs on the Caliber 3255 automatic movement. Famously, the Day-Date was the first watch to indicate the day of the week spelt out in full when it was launched in 1956, and it has gone on to be worn by everyone from the Dalai Lama to numerous US presidents, hence its ‘President’ nickname.
