                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, continuing Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense 'Carrera Panamerica' road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera has long been sought to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams. This addition to the Carrera collection fully embodies that racing heritage with its large 60-second chronograph counter, as well as racing-themed colouring and tachymeter scale on the bezel.
