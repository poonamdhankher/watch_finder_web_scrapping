                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This Daytona flaunts an uber-cool meteorite dial—no two are the same— which perfectly complements the white gold case and burgundy alligator strap. This is an ideal timepiece for those after a classic Rolex with a bit of pizazz.

                            The IWC Portuguese Laureus Sport for Good Foundation prominently features a galvanised blue dial that goes perfectly with the alligator strap. Limited to 2,000 pieces, this watch was made to raise money for the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, a charity that helps disadvantaged children through sports programs – proceeds from each watch were donated to the foundation. IWC makes a Limited Edition Laureus watch every year, always featuring the foundation's “colour of hope” (blue) and a caseback engraving of a child’s drawing, the winner of a themed annual competition. These watches have become highly collectable for fans of IWC.
