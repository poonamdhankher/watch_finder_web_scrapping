                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            This gorgeous Portuguese Automatic has many excellent qualities, but perhaps the most interesting is the movement's power reserve. It's not just the impressive length of stored power, but also the technical ingenuity employed to go above and beyond the call of duty. The watch is engineered to come to an automatic stop after seven days, despite the fact that the actual power reserve is more like eight days. Why? This avoids relying on the last part of the mainspring's stored power, which would entail diminished torque and potential problems with consistent accuracy. When coupled with the Portuguese's handsome appearance and prestigious history, this watch is a very enticing offer indeed.

                            The Transocean collection is one of Breitling's most sophisticated and elegant. Inspired by 1950s and 60s chronograph designs, it brings the brand's unmatched sporting watch prowess to new audiences, powered by Breitling's remarkable chronograph movements. This Unitime Pilot features the company's superb world timer complication, first developed in the 1950s but now improved with in-house calibre B05 (based on the groundbreaking B01). The high-frequency automatic chronograph movement allows the wearer to shift time zones with incredible ease via the crown, which controls the cities, hour hands and 24-hour ring simultaneously.

                            Given the Big Bang's origins, with its porthole-inspired design, there have been nautical themes in the collection from the start—if faint ones. So when it came time for Hublot to create its first “serious” diving watch, it made some sense to turn to the King Power, the even bigger, bolder version of the already spectacular Big Bang series. Hublot was never going to do things by halves. Made of lightweight titanium, this “Oceanographic” has a beastly 48mm case distinguished by the monstrous crown at 2 o'clock (its marginally smaller brother at 4 o'clock is for the inner bezel), and a super-legible, lume-heavy dial. The crystal is a massive 6.5mm thick, providing the immense water resistance (4,000m) that would keep this extraordinary watch safe and sound on the ocean floor.

                            Expanding on their hugely admired Heritage Black Bay series, Tudor released its Black Bay Fifty-Eight in 2018, inspired by the brand’s reference 7924 Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1958—hence the name. Previously released Black Bays, still in production, had bigger cases—41mm, or even 43mm for the bronze model—but at 39mm the Black Bay Fifty-Eight is noticeably smaller and will suit those with a smaller wrist. A classic steel dive watch with a retro feel, including the faux-aged lume and distinctive red triangle on the aluminium bezel, this is a COSC-certified chronometer with 200m water resistance and an in-house movement—unlike the earliest Black Bays. Increasingly sought-after, this is a future classic that has further enhanced Tudor’s reputation and allowed it to step out of the shadow of its older sibling, Rolex.

                            Breitling's legendary Aerospace watches were originally unveiled in the mid-1980s as part of the Navitimer collection, created as the next step in the evolution of the brand's cutting-edge instruments for pilots. With the most accurate, high-tech Swiss superquartz movements on the market, the Aerospace was rapidly adopted by professionals as the ideal multi-function tool watch—its robust and lightweight titanium case and advanced analogue-digital display were also decisive factors in its popularity. Today, Aerospace models remain favourites for collectors and professionals alike, and they continue to provide the outstanding accuracy, reliability and legibility that have long made them so highly prized.

                            Introduced in 2013, the Blackbird is a seriously good looking update for Breitling's Avenger series, and a welcome new member of the brand's growing compendium of awesome “stealth” (black-on-black) pieces. The watch may be a reference to the equally cool, black and stealthy SR-71 Blackbird – a legendary US Air Force reconnaissance plane that played a key part in the Cold War. With its carbon-treated titanium case and comparatively slim profile, this Blackbird is as ergonomic and lightweight as its namesake. The dial is super legible and glare-proof, while the movement is based on a premium Swiss chronometer.
