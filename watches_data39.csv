                            The Cartier Tank has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design—inspired by the shape of a tank—that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            This Panerai Radiomir is 1 of 1000 made and features a ‘tropical’ dial. 
The watch’s dial has been fashioned to resemble the patina seen on vintage Panerai watches which have suffered the effects of radioactive exposure. The Radiomir paint in the vintage watches emitted gamma rays, from the radioactive Radium, and aged the watch in a fashion which turned the originally black paint to a light brown colour. 
Brevetatto, the Italian for patented, is inscribed around the bezel and refers to the design of the watch which adheres to a vintage aesthetic, Panerai have used a 12-sided bezel like those found on prototype watches from the 1930’s.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. A variant on the regular 116710, this reference features gold elements in the bezel, crown, hands, indices and of course the bracelet.

                            When Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the lunar module, codenamed ‘Eagle’, and onto the powdery surface of the moon, the Omega Speedmaster on his wrist became the legendary Moonwatch. Tested to the limits by NASA for the rigours of space flight, the Speedmaster had in fact been into space before the testing had even begun. In October 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra took his own personal Speedmaster on board Sigma 7 and orbited Earth a total of six times for the Mercury 7 mission. The Speedmaster continued to provide NASA astronauts with invaluable service for the Apollo 13 mission, when it was used to time the crucial burn that would return the astronauts safely to Earth.

                            Named after Lake Geneva, the Blancpain Léman collection seeks to capture the evocative natural beauty of this iconic landmark, as well as its proximity to the heart of Swiss watchmaking heritage. With a strong grasp of traditional designs, the Léman watches are classic and authoritative, while simultaneously contemporary and refreshing. This stunning model, known as the Réveil GMT, is notable for its superb mechanical calibre (visible through the caseback), featuring a range of prestigious complications. These include a second timezone and power reserve display, and perhaps most impressive of all, a mechanical alarm.

                            Though they were not a mainstay of the company's catalogue until the 1990s, IWC's Portuguese watches originated as consummate maritime chronometers in the early part of the 20th century, and have established a long and outstanding history of both mechanical and design elegance. Now, the Portuguese has been united with IWC's superb 50000 series of movements (this version houses the 50900), with many exceptional features: a seven-day power reserve that ingeniously stops itself when torque runs low, an escape wheel identical to that of the iconic calibre 89, the brand's hallmark Pellaton pawl-winding system and best of all, a glorious Tourbillon Mystere at 12 o'clock.

                            This watch is not just a classic Submariner—one of the most popular and iconic watches in the world—but a striking and highly collectible variant edition. The watch is easily recognisable thanks to its rare green bezel and dial, causing collectors to give it the affectionate nickname “Hulk”, although LV itself stands for Lunette Vert (“Green Bezel”). This larger version updates the previous LV model ref 16610 (called “Kermit”) that was originally introduced in 2003 for the 50th anniversary of the Submariner. This edition boasts ceramic inserts in the bezel, with numerals in platinum.
