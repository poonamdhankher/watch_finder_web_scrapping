                            The Da Vinci collection has been around for over 30 years now and this Da Vinci Perpetual Calendar Chronograph in 18-karat 5N gold showcases the very best of the range. With the moon sitting still against the dark blue night sky, the moon-phase indicator disc beneath the dial acts as the Earth’s shadow and lies within the totaliser sub-dial which includes the hour and minute counters, both merged at 12 o’clock. Plus, the handy flyback function allows ongoing chronograph measurements to be instantly “deleted” and a new measurement started without an intermediate stop, whereas the perpetual calendar’s sharp precision is made possible by the in-house 89630 calibre. This timepiece is perfect for any avid fans of IWC’s Da Vinci collection and watches that are as functional as they are beautiful.

                            This rare and incredibly elegant perpetual calendar is a true technical marvel. It's not just the quantity of data it records, from the date (including a four-digit year display) to the moonphase (with separate indications for northern and southern hemispheres) and even the seriously impressive seven-day power reserve (indicated inside the 3 o'clock subdial). The most extraordinary part of the watch is in fact the humble—yet sophisticated—crown. Based on the original design by the legendary watchmaker Kurt Klaus, the entire watch is set by the single crown; all components are connected so that you don't have to redo each little display one by one.

                            Panerai has several watches with amazingly long power reserves, yet even by its standards this 10-day Luminor stands out from the crowd. The watch harnesses three large mainspring barrels to generate this much power, and the superb mechanical specs of the in-house P.2003 movement ensure that this energy is distributed cleanly and evenly without any compromise of timekeeping precision. In addition to the power reserve, which has a “linear” display at 6 o'clock, the watch also boasts a GMT complication, using an extra hand from the centre (instantly recognisable thanks to its striking arrowhead). This is accompanied by a day/night indicator inside the small seconds dial.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, continuing Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense 'Carrera Panamerica', road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera has long been sought to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams. This addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its large 60-second chronograph counter, as well as racing-themed colouring and tachymeter scale on the bezel. The watch also benefits from an anti-reflective coating on the scratch-resistant sapphire crystal.

                            The Bell & Ross BR01 represents the cornerstone of the brand's DNA. The series was launched in 2005, marking Bell & Ross's first significant watch family since it ended its partnership with Sinn, and today makes up the majority of the “Aviation” collection. The BR01 is influenced by Sinn's major theme of practicality and quality, but the Bell & Ross mission is to make these kind of serious, practical instruments accessible to those with more concern for lifestyle and fashion. This can be seen in the BR01's urbane, ultra-legible dials and square cases that would not look out of place on an aircraft dashboard.
