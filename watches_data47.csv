                            Panerai has several watches with amazingly long power reserves, yet even by its standards the Radiomir 10 days is stands out from the crowd. The watch harnesses three large mainspring barrels to generate this much power, and the superb mechanical specs of the in-house P.2003 movement ensure that this energy is distributed cleanly and evenly without any compromise of timekeeping precision. In addition to the power reserve, which is displayed on a subdial at 6 o'clock, the watch also boasts a GMT complication, using an extra hand from the centre (instantly recognisable thanks to its striking arrow head). This is accompanied by a day/night indicator inside the small seconds dial.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, continuing Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense 'Carrera Panamerica', road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera has long been sought to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams. This addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its large 60-second chronograph counter, as well as racing-themed colouring and tachymeter scale on the bezel. The watch also benefits from an anti-reflective coating on the scratch-resistant sapphire crystal.
