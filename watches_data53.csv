                            Hailing from a period before TAG’s acquisition of Heuer, the timepiece features the vintage Heuer symbol which has since been made popular again by vintage styled pilots watches.

Made specifically for pilots in the German air force, the Bundeswehr, this timepiece was a utilitarian watch that dates from the Cold War era. As the watches of choice of the German Airforce, who were tasked with the defence of Western Germany, this timepiece represents a tangible link to a compelling period in modern European history.

This Heuer timepiece is a premium example of a vintage pilot’s watch, featuring an ultra-legible dial that is specifically designed to be read in all lighting conditions. The timepiece features a fly back mechanism which is particularly useful for the synchronisation of timing between two aircraft and it bears a dial lumed with tritium, befitting of its vintage status.

                            Fascinating, innovative and technically unique, Jaeger-LeCoultre's Duometre watches are often overlooked despite being one of the most impressive collections in the brand's stable (no small achievement). The watches use a brilliant “dual wing” movement boasting two separate mainspring power sources. The first is used purely for the main time display, and the other caters to additional complications. In this case, the elegant dial showcases the hours and minutes symmetrically opposite a dial combining the date with a sophisticated dual-hemisphere moonphase display. There is a long seconds hand from the centre, while the 6 o'clock subdial features jumping sixths of a second. It's flanked by exquisite exhibition apertures into the movement's workings—including power reserve indicators for each of the “dual wing” sources.

                            Since its first release in 2000, Richard Mille has made the industry stand up and take note with its outlandish, mostly skeletonised watches. Blending design innovation with unorthodox materials, these timepieces are also tough enough to be worn by elite athletes in the thick of the action. Tennis player Rafa Nadal famously wears his on court. This incredible flyback chronograph deep sea dive model stands out among Richard Mille watches for its round, rather than tonneau, case. But all the other signature brand elements are there, including the lightweight titanium case, integrated rubber strap and skeletonization. Striking looks aside, this watch complies with ISO 6425 international dive watch requirements and is water-resistant to 300 metres. Its inwardly sloping bezel also features push-buttons at opposite sides that are held down simultaneously to move the bezel, which is otherwise locked for added safety. The automatic movement holds a power reserve of 45-50 hours, depending on whether the chronograph is running, and it also features an annual calendar. An attention-grabber thanks to its 50mm case size, it’s nonetheless a watch that excels technically.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy of providing racing drivers with high quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its very special Limited Edition carbon fibre dial and superb calibre 16 automatic chronograph movement, fitted with a special day and date function at 3 o'clock.
