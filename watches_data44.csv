                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they're among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79350, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            The Radiomir collection is named after the distinctive luminescent compound Panerai developed when it sold watches to the Italian Navy in the 1930s. Today it is known for several beloved characteristics that have made it an icon of horology—big cushion case; vintage, legible design; sandwich dial; onion crown; and leather strap. Here we have a gorgeous 47mm limited edition in polished pink gold that positively gleams on the wrist. Known as the Ora Rosa, this version features a superb, paired-down dial. The transparent caseback allows the owner to examine the stunning in-house movement P.3000, which boasts two barrels and three days of power.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 448 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, authentic black dial and the blue hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            Originating in Florence, Tuscany, Panerai has a long history of making stylish and extremely reliable watches for professional divers, beginning with its famed WWII contract for the Italian Navy's “Frogmen”. The PAM Submersible pieces are among Panerai's finest diving tools. This superb example features a super-tough black carbon fibre (‘Carbotech’) case and bezel with graduated scale. The watch runs on the in-house P.9000 movement, which boasts a 3-day power reserve from two barrels and allows the wearer to change the time in convenient 1-hour increments. The matching black factory strap is made of a durable rubber that is perfect for diving.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they're among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79350, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            Given the Big Bang's origins, with its porthole-inspired design, there have been nautical themes in the collection from the start—if faint ones. So when it came time for Hublot to create its first “serious” diving watch, it made some sense to turn to the King Power, the even bigger, bolder version of the already spectacular Big Bang series. Hublot was never going to do things by halves. Made of lightweight carbon fibre, this “Oceanographic” has a beastly 48mm case distinguished by the monstrous crown at 2 o'clock (its smaller brother at 4 o'clock is for the inner bezel), and a super-legible dial. The crystal is a massive 6.5mm thick, providing the immense water resistance that would keep this extraordinary watch safe and sound on the ocean floor.

                            Designed by Emmanuelle Gueit to celebrate twenty years since the 1972 release of its now-iconic older brother, the Royal Oak, the Offshore range of watches is said to have influenced the trend for oversized watches that began in the mid 1990s. Similar to its forebear, which was designed by Gerald Genta, the Royal Oak Offshore is bigger and bolder, often paired with tough rubber straps. This particular model features an unusual chocolate brown tapisserie dial paired with blue sub-dials—a truly stunning combination that is complemented by the brown alligator strap. Although the 42mm case is steel, white gold was used for the hour and minutes hands, as well as the rims of the Arabic luminescent numerals. This watch runs on an AP caliber 3126/3840 automatic movement which holds a power reserve of approximately 50 hours.
