                            Before the legendary Calibre 360, which made headlines as the first mechanical chronograph movement capable of measuring hundredths of a second, there was the Calibre 36. Equally legendary, in its way, the 36 displays tenths of a second thanks to its super-high frequency of 5Hz (most high-end chronographs beat at 4Hz). This might remind you of another famous chronograph movement, and you'd be right: the Calibre 36 is a modified version of Zenith's El Primero – ironic, considering Heuer and Zenith were competitors in the famous 1969 race to build the first automatic chrono – although this one has been upgraded with additional flyback capability. This gorgeous, cutting-edge Carrera evolves the remarkable Mikrograph design with a darker ring encompassing a gloriously brushed anthracite centre.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they're among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79350, with a superb chronograph mechanism. While adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            Based in the historic watch-making German town from which it takes its name, Glashutte Original was a company that was absorbed into the collectivized VEB Glashutter Uhrenbetriebe group of watchmakers in the former communist East Germany. After the country’s reunification it re-launched and has been thriving ever since, along with its illustrious neighbour A. Lange & Sohne. This skeletonised edition of the Senator Manual model showcases its manually wound Calibre 49-18 movement, with almost every visible part of it embellished by the exquisite skills of the company’s hand engravers. Adding to the aesthetic beauty is a highly polished 42mm red gold case, within which is galvanized silver dial with black roman numerals and blued-steel leaf hands. The power reserve is a respectable 40 hours.
