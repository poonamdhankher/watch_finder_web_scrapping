                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history (this piece is inspired by its twin-engined Model 247 airliner from the 1930s). The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.

                            This beautiful dress watch from Jaeger-LeCoultre is not just exceptionally well-designed, with a clean, easily readable face and gorgeous case proportions, it also represents phenomenal value for money on its movement, which features several intricate complications. The watch, released in 2014 and inspired by a vintage 1945 piece from the JLC archives, has a moonphase and a complete calendar with displays for date, day of the week, and month. With all this, it still manages to maintain a refined, minimalist aesthetic based around a highly uncluttered dial—in large part thanks to the uncommon pointer-type date display around the dial's circumference.

                            Expanding on their hugely admired Heritage Black Bay series, Tudor released its Black Bay Fifty-Eight in 2018, inspired by the brand’s reference 7924 Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1958—hence the name. Previously released Black Bays, still in production, had bigger cases—41mm, or even 43mm for the bronze model—but at 39mm the Black Bay Fifty-Eight is noticeably smaller and will suit those with a smaller wrist. A classic steel dive watch with a retro feel, including the faux-aged lume and distinctive red triangle on the aluminium bezel, this is a COSC-certified chronometer with 200m water resistance and an in-house movement—unlike the earliest Black Bays. Increasingly sought-after, this is a future classic that has further enhanced Tudor’s reputation and allowed it to step out of the shadow of its older sibling, Rolex.

                            Expanding on their hugely admired Heritage Black Bay series, Tudor released its Black Bay Fifty-Eight in 2018, inspired by the brand’s reference 7924 Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1958—hence the name. Previously released Black Bays, still in production, had bigger cases—41mm, or even 43mm for the bronze model—but at 39mm the Black Bay Fifty-Eight is noticeably smaller and will suit those with a smaller wrist. A classic steel dive watch with a retro feel, including the faux-aged lume and distinctive red triangle on the aluminium bezel, this is a COSC-certified chronometer with 200m water resistance and an in-house movement—unlike the earliest Black Bays. Increasingly sought-after, this is a future classic that has further enhanced Tudor’s reputation and allowed it to step out of the shadow of its older sibling, Rolex.

                            Bell & Ross has long been passionate about military watches—unsurprising given its perpetual focus on bringing function and utility to the forefront of luxury watchmaking. Most of the brand's true military styles have been reserved for the Vintage collection, but some of the best pieces to receive its coveted “Military Type” label can in fact be found in the instrument series (BR01 and BR03), which was originally based on aircraft cockpit instruments. Bell & Ross state that these pieces pay tribute to the first professionals, historically, who relied on wristwatches. They display an authentic military awareness of a need for extreme legibility, both at day and night, as well as serious durability and precision.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history (this piece is inspired by its twin-engined Model 247 airliner from the 1930s). The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.
