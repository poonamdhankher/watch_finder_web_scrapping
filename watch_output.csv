                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            The Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore, first introduced in 1993 and designed by Emmanuel Gueit, takes the bold nature of the Royal Oak to the next level. It's the brand's sportiest collection, featuring large case sizes and striking or exaggerated designs. Often described as “larger-than-life”, the Offshore is visually impressive, with dramatic design cues that exaggerate and heighten those of its predecessor. The watch develops ideas from the original Royal Oak, pioneered by the legendary Gerald Genta in 1972. This is a remarkable example of one of the most iconic collections from an ultra-prestigious Swiss brand.

                            Patrouille Suisse is the acclaimed aerobatics team of the Swiss Air Force. Flying since 1964, the team was known for its Hawker Hunter aircraft until the 1990s, when it switched to the Northrop F-5Es that it currently uses. There are many partnerships between aerobatics teams and watch companies, but perhaps none more perfect than this of Patrouille Suisse and Breitling, the Swiss watchmaking giant known for its prestigious history of pilots watches. This piece is indeed a limited edition Chronomat, sharing a name with one of the earliest and most influential Breitling watches in the second half of the 20th century. Featuring a special patch in the 9 o'clock subdial, and using a superb Swiss movement with an automatic chronograph and a second time zone, this watch celebrates Patrouille Suisse's 50th anniversary.

                            Created by Gerald Genta and like many of his famous watches, the Nautilus is a horological legend. Patek Philippe's most well known and desirable sports watch, it's celebrated for some of the best examples of emblematic Genta trademarks: large, angular bezel, comparatively thin case, integrated bracelet and bold, if straightforward, dial. The design is based on the traditional shape of portholes, up to and including the hinges often found on the sides—hence the Nautilus' unmistakable 'ears'. This model brings extra appeal in the form of a stunning movement with several additional complications: a small seconds, a power reserve indicator, and most impressively, a combined date and moonphase display.

                            This watch is not just a classic Submariner—one of the most popular and iconic watches in the world—but a striking and highly collectible variant edition. The watch is easily recognisable thanks to its rare green bezel and dial, causing collectors to give it the affectionate nickname “Hulk”, although LV itself stands for Lunette Vert (“Green Bezel”). This larger version updates the previous LV model ref 16610 (called “Kermit”) that was originally introduced in 2003 for the 50th anniversary of the Submariner. This edition boasts ceramic inserts in the bezel, with numerals in platinum.

                            The Royal Oak is one of the most iconic watches in history – a product of the same genius designer, Gerald Genta, who was responsible for the likes of Patek Philippe's Nautilus and IWC's Ingenieur. The story is a dramatic one – Audemars Piguet had been lingering on the edge of collapse since the Depression, but the unprecedentedly bold lines, steel case and luxury pricing turned Genta's creation into an enormous success that saved the prestigious company. The Offshore collection, meanwhile, was designed by Emmanuel Gueit in 1993, and represents the next step in the evolution of the brand's signature creation. While sticking to the classic elements of the original Royal Oak, the Offshore takes its bold nature even further.

                            The Speedmaster is so closely associated with NASA and the Moon landings these days that it's easy to forget that when it was first released in the 1950s, it was not remotely intended for space travel. Rather, as the name suggests, the Speedy was designed as a sports watch for timing things like motor racing. Certain models, both vintage and modern, have re-established that link somewhat, including a number of “racing” editions with checkered patterns on the dials resembling finish flags. This wonderful example made a big splash at Baselworld 2013 and has been nicknamed “Tintin”, because of its red and white pattern, directly inspired by the spaceship used by the comic book hero to go to the Moon.

                            The Alinghi team, under the colours of the Swiss yacht club, made history in 2003 when it challenged for and won the ultra-prestigious America's Cup in Aukland (a.k.a. “City of Sails”) on its first attempt. Audemars Piguet, which had sponsored the previous Swiss team Be Happy, also got behind Alinghi, releasing a number of very special limited edition watches, including this marvellous and highly collectible Royal Oak, in honour of the event. The piece also commemorates the 30th anniversary of the legendary Royal Oak itself, one of the most celebrated watch designs to emerge in the second half of the 20th century.

                            This masterful Luminor 1950 from Panerai features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph (also known as a rattrapante), one of high-end watchmaking's most challenging mechanical complications to manufacture. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden; an extra pusher at 8 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other hand continues to run. The PAM 213 uses the OP XVIII movement, based on a stunning and unusual column wheel Valjoux 7750.

                            Having a date indicator on a watch is taken for granted these days, but before 1945, the concept didn't exist at all—that is until Rolex added a simple, yet game-changing element to their famous Oyster watch: the date window. This small aperture changed the role of wristwatches from then on, from mere timekeeping devices to calendars as well. The Datejust was (and is) also known for its classic elegance—the watch is striking in its magnificent, minimalist beauty. Many of these timepieces feature dials or cases made with rare and exquisite materials, which only adds to their graceful and luxurious reputation. In 2009 the look was slightly adjusted and modernised with the Datejust II—the main difference being the change in case size from 36 to 41mm.

                            Originally an ancient fortress in Spain, Calatrava was the site of key medieval battles between Christian and Muslim forces and the foundation of the noble brotherhood of religious knights, the Order of Calatrava. The emblem of these knights was to be adopted many centuries later by perhaps Switzerland's most prestigious and revered watchmaker of all time, Patek Philippe, as the brand logo. And its flagship watch collection was bestowed the name Calatrava in honour of this historical connection. Calatrava watches are among the most elegant and distinguished in the world, displaying a flawless, understated stylishness rooted in the finest Swiss traditions, combined with the avant-guard aesthetic in vogue at the time of the first Calatravas in the early 1930s.

                            This Rolex Daytona Cosmograph was designed to meet the needs of professional racing drivers upon its original release in 1963, with a reliable chronograph and bezel with tachymetric scale, allowing drivers to measure average speeds of up to 400 MPH. The name nods to Daytona, Florida—the home of a strong passion for speed and motor racing that emerged in the early 20th century. The relationship between Rolex and motor racing strengthened in 2013 when the watchmaker decided to enter the world of Formula 1, as Global Partner and Official Timepiece of the exhilarating sport. The 116520 introduced the in-house calibre 4130, a replacement to the Zenith-sourced 4030 in the previous 16520 and has become one of the most popular sports models ever created.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with high quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage while daring to forge its own path.

                            Born as the amalgamation of incredible new technologies developed by Rolex, COMEX (the French deep-sea diving company) and the US Navy during the late 60s, the Sea-Dweller is Rolex's ultra-durable dive computer. In production for more than four decades, the 16600 model featured such pioneering technology as a helium escape valve and a 1,220m water resistance, and received a major upgrade in the form of the 116660 Deepsea model seen here. With a three-piece “Ringlock” case, “Triplock” crown system and 5mm sapphire crystal, this watch can survive pressures that would flatten a submarine. Its water resistance rating is an incredible 3,900m—deeper than the average depth of the ocean.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors.

                            Like many of its iconic watch families, Rolex's Milgauss was created in 1956 with a specific market in mind: scientists, power station workers and anyone else exposed to high magnetic fields. It was designed to be able to resist fields up to 1,000 gauss (hence the name—“mille” is Latin for thousand). The watch built a solid reputation with only two models until 1988, and was happily revived two decades later in a modern re-edition that remains faithful to the original purpose and aesthetics—including the beloved lightning bolt hand. This gorgeous GV version (Glace Verte) has a green-tinted dial crystal, and uses a Parachrom-Blu hairspring for even better magnetic and shock resistance.

By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors.

                            The Air King was named in honour of the brave RAF pilots of WWII, when Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, discovered they were ditching their standard issue watches for his Oyster Perpetual. As one of its longest continuously manufactured and most affordable watches, the Air King is a beloved staple of Rolex's range. At Baselworld 2016, the brand released this superbly updated model. It refreshes the classic look, upgrading size, durability and calibre precision while staying true to its aviation heritage in such key elements as the iconic 1950s Air-King font. Many believe that the dial design is inspired by the custom dashboard timepieces Rolex supplied to the Bloodhound SSC land speed record attempt.

                            The Ballon Bleu, one of Cartier's newest watch collections, has been hugely successful since its 2007 release. With a unique, curving, organic case, a cleverly integrated sapphire crown and a multi-facetted guilloché dial, the watch can rightly be called a gem in every sense, blending the best of classical elegance and futuristic originality. Creating beauty through simplicity, the watch showcases everything that makes Cartier such a prestigious and highly-sought brand. This model uses a superb Swiss automatic movement underneath the traditional Roman numerals and blue sword hands on the dial. It's a timepiece that has to been seen in the flesh to get the full effect.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they are among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79240, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilot's watches. While the concept was successful and enjoyed various upgrades (including input from the legendary Gerald Genta), it was beginning to peter out in the early naughties. Seeking to refresh the collection, IWC partnered with Mercedes' high performance division, AMG, to create a series of cutting-edge timepieces that demonstrated both brands' commitment to the highest precision engineering. This model is made from zirconium-based ceramic, inspired by AMG's disc brakes, and houses the famous in-house Caliber 80110.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. A variant on the regular 116710, this reference features gold elements in the bezel, crown, hands, indices and of course the bracelet.

                            This modern Rolex GMT Master II features a superb calibre 3186 (with parachrom hairspring and Breguet overcoil) and a gorgeous white gold case. But its most impressive asset is the classic-looking bezel, returning in the original blue and red. The GMT Master has long been known for its two-tone bezel, to differentiate day and night for pilots using the watch for long-distance flights, but this one is made of a single block of cerachrom, using a patented process that makes it one of the first watches to feature ceramic components in multiple colours.

                            This Rolex Daytona Cosmograph was designed to meet the needs of professional racing drivers upon its original release in 1963, with a reliable chronograph and bezel with tachymetric scale, allowing drivers to measure average speeds of up to 400 MPH. The name nods to Daytona, Florida—the home of a strong passion for speed and motor racing that emerged in the early 20th century. The relationship between Rolex and motor racing strengthened in 2013 when the watchmaker decided to enter the world of Formula 1, as Global Partner and Official Timepiece of the exhilarating sport. The 116520 introduced the in-house calibre 4130, a replacement to the Zenith-sourced 4030 in the previous 16520 and has become one of the most popular sports models ever created.

                            The legendary 5205 features several great complications, chief among which is surely the annual calendar. Patek revolutionised calendar complications when it invented the annual calendar in the 1990s, a complication with almost as much complexity and convenience as its perpetual counterpart, only needing to be set once per year. As in the equally well-known ref. 5960, the 5205's calendar is displayed via three small, instant-jumping and remarkably easy-to-read windows at the top of the watch. They nicely mirror a moonphase and 24-hour subdial combined at the bottom. With a concentric dial design, the watch takes on a wonderful, almost sporty appeal, while retaining every inch of the elegance for which Patek Philippe is so well loved.

                            It's rare for Rolex to create completely new watch collections, but this is what happened in 2012 with the exceptional Sky-Dweller. It's not just the design that's new – the watch also features a complication never seen in a Rolex watch before, the annual calendar. This difficult mechanical addition has been ever so subtly integrated. The main way you will even notice it is when the date magically jumps after months with only 30 days. There's a small indicator next to each hour marker; the black one shows the current month. This would all be remarkable in itself, but it's arguably overshadowed by the innovative new GMT display, occupying much of the central dial, and the even more innovative bezel. The latter has been upgraded with a “Ring Command” function that allows you to set the time and the other complications in a simple, intuitive fashion.

                            Invented in 1904, the Santos was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented for aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont to make it easier to check the time while flying. The watch was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, and to celebrate the origins of the timepiece, Cartier produced a wonderful series of Santos watches called the Santos 100. Modern Santos watches still maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numeral hour markers and fully incorporated lugs.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This recent model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting a cutting-edge movement, a magnificent gold case and bracelet, and high-tech cerachrom inserts in the bezel. The LN moniker stands for Lunette Noir—signifying that it uses an all-black bezel.

                            Calatrava watches, named after an order of ancient Spanish knights, are among the most elegant and distinguished in the world. They are known for their flawless, understated stylishness rooted in the finest Swiss traditions, combined with the avant-garde aesthetic in vogue at the time of the first Calatravas in the early 1930s. This version in yellow gold is as understated as they come and features an intricate hobnail-effect bezel within which the lacquered-finish white dial stands out. The elegant Roman numerals and simple stick hands in black—matching the crocodile leather strap— add to the timeless aesthetic and the automatic movement is housed in an especially slim case that makes it perfect for formal occasions.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 divers conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. In 2009, the design received a significant overhaul, leading to a new range of magnificent models like the very special, limited edition, black titanium watch for sale here, with its ceramic bezel, black lume, and striking, uncluttered dial. The black nylon strap is also an appreciated addition to the overall sleek, stealthy aesthetic. The piece maintains an excellent 300 meter water resistance, protecting the fine Swiss movement inside the Calibre 5.

                            For a long time known as “just” Rolex's junior partner, the Tudor brand finally came into its own in 2010 with the exceptional Heritage collection. The company was originally created by Hans Wilsdorf in 1946 as a more affordable version of Rolex – watches built to the same quality standards but without the in-house movements. Capturing the glorious vintage essence of Tudor watches from yesteryear, but without any faux-vintage affectations, the recent Heritage models represent a perfect meeting of old and new. The Black Bay in particular draws on a wonderful synthesis of historic Tudor design cues, from the big crown to the snowflake hands and the rich brown and gold colour palette.

                            Part of Patek Philippe’s long-running Calatrava line, the Pilot Travel Time, released in 2015, nods to the aesthetic simplicity of the Calatrava while incorporating several practical features that take it way beyond its time-only dress watch origins. Set in a superb rose gold case, the mesmerising black-brown gradient dial is complemented by gold applied Arabic numerals with luminescent coating for excellent legibility in all conditions. The sub-dial at 6 o’clock displays the date, and a second hour hand—skeletonised—gives a second time zone, along with day and night indicators for each zone. It’s powered by the Caliber 324 S C FUS, an automatic movement with 18k gold rotor visible through the transparent caseback. This is a useful, elegant yet robust timepiece from this hallowed brand.

                            It was in 1904 that Louis Cartier gave a watch to his good friend and aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont that was designed to be worn on the wrist. The Santos watch was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented to make it easier to check the time while flying. It was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, as well as a very early example of the iconic Art Deco style that would influence fashion and watchmaking for decades. The modern Santos watches maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numerals and fully incorporated lugs.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with high quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage while daring to forge its own path, boasting an energetic modern design with classic racing-red highlights, along with superb finishing and the excellent calibre 16 inside.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 divers conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its unidirectional bezel, exceptionally legible design and superb finishing and craftsmanship. The piece maintains an excellent 300 meter water resistance, protecting the TAG Heuer Calibre 5 inside.

                            The Luminor design originated in the early 1950s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market—though it remained firmly rooted in the look and feel of the military watches of the '30s and '40s when the company was born. The new watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. The 44mm PAM 312 is particularly attractive thanks to its use of the stunning P.9000 movement, made in-house by Panerai, with a power reserve of 3 days.

                            This is a special limited edition Speedmaster made by Omega to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11. The first time humans landed on the moon, this was also the occasion on which the Speedmaster officially became the legendary Moonwatch, as Buzz Aldrin wore one during the inaugural moonwalk (Neil Armstrong left his onboard as a backup for a malfunctioning computer). This limited edition features the famous Apollo 11 “eagle” mission patch on the small seconds subdial and engraved on the caseback, and also has an extra line of text on the dial that remembers the exact time that Armstrong made his “one small step”.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet, not to mention the subtle and effective use of gold in this reference.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with high-quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This superb addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage, adding a particularly elegant, wearable model with a pared-down design that cuts to the best of what Heuer can provide.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade “superalloy” steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. The LN moniker stands for Lunette Noir—signifying that it uses an all-black bezel.

                            Rolex has long been popular among women who know their horology. Unlike some brands that relegate ladies' watches to mere fashion statements, Rolex devotes just as much care and attention to its mechanical credentials as it does for watches aimed at men. The 'Lady' Oyster Perpetual participates in the same legendary history of Rolex's groundbreaking introduction of vital new technologies in the early 20th century, the Oyster case providing the first real water resistance, and the perpetual rotor allowing watches to run without manual winding. Slimmed-down in size to a 26mm case, this model with black dial and quarter Arabic numerals carries the same stunning elegance and attention to detail with which Rolex is synonymous.

                            The Speedmaster is one of the most iconic watches ever made by Omega, if not any brand. The company has done a strong trade in developing the watch's stratospheric reputation as the first and only timepiece worn on the Moon during the Apollo missions. Of the many special editions released, the all-ceramic “Dark Side of the Moon” was among the most memorable. This incredible version updates the Dark Side (originally inspired by the extraordinary Apollo 8 mission) with an edition called “Black Black”. The case, bezel and dial are all made of a deep black ceramic with black Super-LumiNova that creates even fewer contrasts than its predecessor. There's even a pitch black nylon strap.

                            It's the watch that originally made Rolex the industry-leading, super-desirable brand that it is today. First developed in the 1920s and 30s, the Oyster Perpetual combined the brand's groundbreaking waterproof case (Oyster) with its superb self-winding, in-house movement (Perpetual), creating an icon of watchmaking that would supply the foundation for legends like the Submariner. Today, the name is still used for many of its finest watches, but the true product survives in this stunning ref. 116000, new in 2014. Retaining the watch's flawless, classic design, evolved subtly for modern tastes, and its peerless mechanical prowess, this is a gorgeous timepiece for those who want something timeless.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            The Air King was named in honour of the brave RAF pilots of WWII, when Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, discovered they were ditching their standard issue watches for his Oyster Perpetual. As one of its longest continuously manufactured and most affordable watches, the Air King is a beloved staple of Rolex's range. At Baselworld 2016, the brand released this superbly updated model. It refreshes the classic look, upgrading size, durability and calibre precision while staying true to its aviation heritage in such key elements as the iconic 1950s Air-King font. Many believe that the dial design is inspired by the custom dashboard timepieces Rolex supplied to the Bloodhound SSC land speed record attempt.

                            The Yacht-Master, introduced by Rolex in 1992 in a gold case, was the first all-new watch from the brand since the Daytona in the 1960s. The watch was designed for adventurers and sportsmen—the topside equivalent to the diver's Submariner, to which it bears a strong similarity, though with more of a luxury than a tool watch feel. By 1999 it had become one of the most highly sought and desirable models in the Rolex stable after the introduction of a platinum version, though it wasn't until 2005 that the Rolesor reference 16623 arrived. Rolesor is the brand's term for two-tone watches that use both steel and gold, which this one does so in serious style. Like all Yacht-Masters, the bezel is made of a single block of solid gold.

                            Born as the amalgamation of incredible new technologies developed by Rolex, COMEX (the French deep-sea diving company) and the US Navy during the late 60s, the Sea-Dweller is Rolex's ultra-durable dive computer. In production for more than four decades, the 16600 model featured such pioneering technology as a helium escape valve and a 1,220m water resistance, and received a major upgrade in the form of the 116660 Deepsea model seen here. With a three-piece “Ringlock” case, “Triplock” crown system and 5mm sapphire crystal, this watch can survive pressures that would flatten a submarine. Its water resistance rating is an incredible 3,900m—deeper than the average depth of the ocean.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 448 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, authentic black dial and the blue hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            Partnering with one of the biggest American companies of the last century, Pan American Airways, Rolex created a watch that was capable of telling the time in more than one place or time zone—the GMT-Master. In 1983 the updated GMT-Master II was released, gaining the nickname “The Fat Lady” due to its chunky case. Later, in 2005, Rolex redesigned and rereleased the GMT-Master on its 50th anniversary by launching the GMT-Master II. This new release became the first Rolex sport watch with the new, larger case and ceramic bezel—famed for its scratch resistance and immunity to fading. Its updated 3186 calibre boasted some improvements compared to the older 3185, making the hour hand a lot easier to set. It also featured a new hairspring which was a lot less sensitive to temperature changes and magnetism—perfect for flying and travelling, just as the original intended. This special GMT-Master II—made of white gold—is the sequel to the watch that introduced the much-anticipated Pepsi ceramic bezel, now coming with a blue dial instead of white, for this second generation run.

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. The watch builds on the heritage of the legendary Explorer I, which has always been a firm favourite among enthusiasts—the watch was first established in the public mind after its pioneering ascent of Everest during the expedition of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Today the Explorer II deviates in some ways from the original look, but it continues to represent an exceptional, hardy, modernised tool watch with a top-of-the-range in-house movement and a design that does justice to its legacy in both sports and adventure.

                            This is a very special Sea-Dweller diving watch that represents several major firsts for Rolex. Released in honour of director James Cameron's headline-grabbing solo descent to the Challenger Deep at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the watch has the highest water resistance rating of any piece made available to the public (3,900m)—although not as high as the concept watch Cameron took with him. Another first is the remarkable dial, which shifts like the ocean from blue to black. The green text matches the colour of Cameron's submarine, the 'Deepsea Challenger'. Finally, perhaps rarest of all, the watch was unveiled at a special press event in the summer of 2014. It's almost unheard of for the brand to launch anything outside of Baselworld.

                            Rolex has long been popular among women who know their horology. Unlike some brands that relegate ladies' watches to mere fashion statements, Rolex gives just as much care and attention to their mechanical credentials as it does for watches aimed at men. The Lady Datejust participates in the same legendary horological history of Rolex's groundbreaking introduction of the date window in 1945, and still bears the famous 'Superlative Chronometer Officially Certified' on the dial. Its slimmed-down size allows for stunning elegance and attention to detail, and its exceptionally attractive minimalism has ensured it remains a popular choice for sophisticated women.

                            The Yacht-Master was originally introduced by Rolex in 1992—the first all-new model from the brand since the Daytona in 1964. The watch was designed for adventurers and sportsmen, like the topside equivalent of the diver's Submariner, to which it bears certain similarities. This version updates the classic model with extraordinary mechanical upgrades. The chronograph mechanism has been tailored specifically to yachtsmen's needs, with a programmable 10-minute countdown feature for timing start sequences at regattas. The bezel, built with flawless ceramic inserts, is even more ingenious. Its bidirectional turning is linked to the movement, meaning you can use its simple and intuitive 'ring command system' to set the watch and its complications.

                            Having a date indicator on a watch is taken for granted these days, but before 1945, the concept didn't exist at all—until Rolex added a simple, yet game-changing element to their famous Oyster watch: the date window. This small aperture changed the role of wristwatches from mere timekeeping devices to calendars as well. The Datejust was (and is) known for its classic elegance—the watch is striking in its magnificent, minimalist beauty. This delightful 'mid-size' model, which comes in a variety of dial colours and materials, is intended for use by both men and women.

                            The brainchild of legendary watch designer Gerald Genta, the Nautilus was introduced in 1976 to compete with Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak, another now-iconic Genta-designed steel sports watch launched a few years earlier. Its case shape, with ear-like projections either side, was like nothing the industry had seen before and despite not being an immediate hit it’s now one of the most sought-after Patek models around. Notably, this all-steel reference 5980 model from 2008 features a single, concentrically designed sub-dial at 6 o’clock to display its chronograph functions, while a small aperture at 3 o’clock displays the date, discreetly set amongst the signature horizontal ridges of the stunning blue-grey dial. Through the transparent caseback, the gold rotor of the automatic Caliber CH 28-520 movement can be viewed. This is a highly sought-after timepiece, now discontinued, from arguably the world’s most illustrious watch brand.

                            Patek Philippe, one of the most prestigious watch firms in all of Switzerland, has a sparkling history when it comes to timepieces for ladies. For at leat 150 years, its jewellery watches have been the best of the best, and the acclaimed Twenty-4 collection is no exception. Launched in 1999, it is inspired by, and in many ways represents an evolution of, the brand's famed Gondolo watches, and draws on the timeless Art Deco style that Patek Philippe does so well. This gorgeous rectangular model features a consummately elegant, minimalist design with diamonds in two rows (on the case and as indices on the dial) framing single Roman numerals at 6 and 12. At once classic, refined and dazzling, this is a phenomenal piece of horology is not to be missed.

                            It was in 1904 that Louis Cartier gave a watch to his good friend and aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont that was designed to be worn on the wrist. The Santos watch was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented to make it easier to check the time while flying. It was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, as well as a very early example of the iconic Art Deco style that would influence fashion and watchmaking for decades. The modern Santos watches maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numerals and fully incorporated lugs—as well as the stunning guilloché dial on this model.

                            For a long time known as 'just' Rolex's younger sibling, the Tudor brand finally came into its own in 2010 with the exceptional Heritage collection. The company was originally created by Hans Wilsdorf in 1946 as a more affordable alternative to Rolex—watches built to the same quality standards but without the in-house movements. Capturing the glorious essence of Tudor watches from yesteryear, but without any faux-vintage affectations, the recent Heritage models represent a perfect meeting of old and new. The Black Bay in particular draws on a wonderful synthesis of historic Tudor design cues, from the big crown to the snowflake hands and the gorgeous burgundy bezel.

                            Longines added a new dive model to its Heritage line with this 2014 release. Inspired by the brand’s diving watches of the 1970s, the Heritage Diver is a true homage to the watchmaker’s past, but with modern additions such as updated movements. This piece features a 43mm cushion-shaped case which adds to the retro aesthetic of the watch, as well as a date window at 6 o’clock and two chronograph sub dials at 3 and 9 o’clock—making this a useful timepiece indeed. The additional crown at 10 o’clock moves the inner bezel and the black dial flaunts a pop of colour thanks to the red markings and second hand. Powered by an automatic movement, this watch is perfect for fans of vintage watches, and one that’ll see you through land and sea with ease.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, and continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950’s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its lovely, paired-down tribute to vintage timepieces. The watch uses TAG's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features a modern version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

                            For a long time known as 'just' Rolex's younger sibling, the Tudor brand finally came into its own in 2010 with the exceptional Heritage collection. The company was originally created by Hans Wilsdorf in 1946 as a more affordable alternative to Rolex—watches built to the same quality standards but without the in-house movements. Capturing the glorious essence of Tudor watches from yesteryear, but without any faux-vintage affectations, the recent Heritage models represent a perfect meeting of old and new. The Black Bay in particular draws on a wonderful synthesis of historic Tudor design cues, from the big crown to the snowflake hands and the gorgeous burgundy bezel.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, and continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950’s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its lovely, paired-down tribute to vintage timepieces. The watch uses TAG's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features a modern version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

This model sees the familiar and iconic shape of the Carrera enhanced with an avant-garde (and larger) case build and a striking skeletonised dial. The 45mm titanium-carbide coated case is modular in design, constructed entirely in-house. The same goes for the movement (a modified version of the brand's superb Cal. 1887), which together with the skeletonisation and the red highlights creates a hi-tech aesthetic that builds on the watch's historical race car legacy.

                            For a long time known as 'just' Rolex's younger sibling, the Tudor brand finally came into its own in 2010 with the exceptional Heritage collection. The company was originally created by Hans Wilsdorf in 1946 as a more affordable alternative to Rolex—watches built to the same quality standards but without the in-house movements. Capturing the glorious essence of Tudor watches from yesteryear, but without any faux-vintage affectations, the recent Heritage models represent a perfect meeting of old and new. The Black Bay in particular draws on a wonderful synthesis of historic Tudor design cues, from the big crown to the snowflake hands and the gorgeous burgundy bezel.

                            Introduced in 2013, the Blackbird is a seriously good looking update for Breitling's Avenger series, and a welcome new member of the brand's growing compendium of awesome “stealth” (black-on-black) pieces. The watch may be a reference to the equally cool, black and stealthy SR-71 Blackbird – a legendary US Air Force reconnaissance plane that played a key part in the Cold War. With its carbon-treated titanium case and comparatively slim profile, this Blackbird is as ergonomic and lightweight as its namesake. The dial is super legible and glare-proof, while the movement is based on a premium Swiss chronometer.

                            The Chronospace uses Breitling's iconic digital-analogue display, pioneered in the early '80s when it played a major part in reviving the brand after the trials and tribulations of the quartz crisis. The design stays true to the company's legendary aviation heritage, with an imposing 48mm case that prioritises ruggedness and practicality—but doesn't neglect its stylish aesthetics. The watch features a memorable dial with oversize numerals at 3 and 9, and boasts a top-of-the-range, thermocompensated Superquartz movement with a host of functionalities. There's also the superb quality finishing and the consummate attention to detail that characterises all Breitling timepieces.

                            In both name and spirit, the Calibre 01 represents the first of what is expected to become a series of modernised upgrades for TAG Heuer timepieces masterminded by legend of the watchmaking world, Jean-Claude Biver. This model sees the familiar and iconic shape of the Carrera enhanced with an avant-garde (and larger) case build and a striking skeletonised dial. The 45mm titanium-carbide coated case is modular in design, constructed entirely in-house. The same goes for the movement (a modified version of the brand's superb Cal. 1887), which together with the skeletonisation and the red highlights creates a hi-tech aesthetic that builds on the watch's historical race car legacy.

                            In both name and spirit, the Calibre 01 represents the first of what is expected to become a series of modernised upgrades for TAG Heuer timepieces masterminded by legend of the watchmaking world, Jean-Claude Biver. This model sees the familiar and iconic shape of the Carrera enhanced with an avant-garde (and larger) case build and a striking skeletonised dial. The 45mm titanium-carbide coated case is modular in design, constructed entirely in-house. The same goes for the movement (a modified version of the brand's superb Cal. 1887), which together with the skeletonisation and the red highlights creates a hi-tech aesthetic that builds on the watch's historical race car legacy.

                            Rolex has long been popular among women who know their horology. Unlike some brands that relegate ladies' watches to mere fashion statements, Rolex gives just as much care and attention to their mechanical credentials as it does for watches aimed at men. After all, the brand's founder, Hans Wilsdorf, launched his original, groundbreaking Oyster Perpetual on the neck of the legendary female swimmer Mercedes Gleitze on her record-breaking crossing of the English Channel. The Datejust introduced another world first in 1945 when it added a date window, and its slim, elegant and minimalist design has made it one of the top choices for sophisticated women ever since.

                            One of the oldest watchmakers in the world—only Blancpain has been around longer, at just three years more—Jaquet Droz has produced some remarkable creations. In its early years, the watchmaker extended its craft outside of horology when founder Pierre Jaquet-Droz created three automatas—a kind of mechanical puppet—which dazzled audiences at the time. Aside from the animatronics, Jaquet Droz has created this Grande Seconde Email Ivoire. Inside, this watch is powered by the Frederic Piguet calibre 1150—a world-class movement also used by both Blancpain and Breguet. Flaunting a minimalistic aesthetic with a cream enamel dial created using the painstaking Grand Feu process—baking fine enamel powder onto a copper blank at almost one thousand degrees Celsius—this is a process at which Jaquet Droz are industry leaders. The watch also features a large sub-seconds dial, as well as hours and minutes dial. This is a unique piece from an incredibly charming watchmaker.

                            In 2014, when Jaguar announced it was making the six “remaining” Lightweight versions of the iconic E-Type (the gorgeous 60s model described as the most beautiful car ever made), it partnered with another British high-end brand, Bremont, to release six very special accompanying timepieces. Due to popular demand, these watches have since gone into production and the Jaguar has become a beloved member of the Bremont stable. Its success stems from its stunning use of E-Type design codes, from the Dunlop tyre tread on the crown to the Jaguar heritage logo, to the tachometer-inspired dial design with the same font and “red line quadrant” as the original cars.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history. This exceptionally rare GMT limited edition, boasting an advanced aerospace-grade titanium case, was made exclusively for Royal Navy crew members who operate a Merlin helicopter—an image of which can be seen on the dial.

                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            For many Panerai collectors, the “Base” Luminor models are considered an excellent purchase, as they tend to represent fantastic value for money and many are rare thanks to their small production runs. This model, for example, was made in only 2,000 units sold exclusively at boutique stores. The Base watches are similar if not identical in many respects to other models that cost far more. The key difference is the hour numerals, which are painted rather than cut out of a sandwich dial. While sandwiches are more closely identified with Panerai and arguably more authentic, many prefer the look and feel of the painted version, which is said to “pop” better than its counterpart.

                            The highly anticipated Rio Olympics are fast approaching, and naturally they have provided good cause for Omega to celebrate its enduring position as Official Timekeeper with a range of superb new special watches. This colourful limited edition is a take on the brand's legendary, ultra-rare 1969 “Bullhead” stopwatch. The name, of course, is derived from the unusual positioning of the crown and pushers on the top of the case. This stunning vintage reproduction stays faithful in most respects to the look of the original, with its distinctive wedge-shaped case and the 6 o'clock crown (which controls the internal bezel). The biggest change is the Olympic-themed colour scheme, and of course the fantastic modern movement 3113.

                            In 2014, when Jaguar announced it was making the six “remaining” Lightweight versions of the iconic E-Type (the gorgeous 60s model described as the most beautiful car ever made), it partnered with another British high-end brand, Bremont, to release six very special accompanying timepieces. Due to popular demand, these watches have since gone into production and the Jaguar has become a beloved member of the Bremont stable. Its success stems from its stunning use of E-Type design codes, from the Dunlop tyre tread on the crown to the Jaguar heritage logo, to the tachometer-inspired dial design with the same font and “red line quadrant” as the original cars.

All of Blancpain's 300 years of experience at the very highest levels of haute horlogerie is brought to bear in this beautiful series. This particularly excellent model features a complete set of calendar and moonphase complications, marking it as a superb example of high-end mechanical accomplishment.

                            Ayrton Senna was one of the most gifted racing drivers of all time. Tragically killed in an accident at the San Marino Grand Prix when he was 34, Senna made his name with his terrific skill, three world championships and notorious rivalries, and his legend endures to this day. The great man is honoured by this extraordinary all-ceramic Hublot limited edition, featuring his Brazilian colours on the dial (as well as a flag on the side of the case), and the Ayrton Senna Institute logo on the caseback. As an energetic Formula 1 tribute with an explosive design and build, the watch features amazing complications, including an impressive split seconds chronograph and the foudroyante (jumping) eighth of a second subdial.

                            Luxury watchmaking in England was given a welcome boost with the launch of Bremont in 2002. Founded by brothers Giles and Nick English, it began by making beautifully crafted pilots’ watches, most of which are ISO chronometer rated, and has brought out a number of intriguing limited editions that incorporate history into the actual watch in the most literal sense. This model features an actual piece of fabric used on the 1903 Wright Flyer aircraft that marked the beginning of the pioneer era of aviation. It can be seen through the transparent caseback, as can the automatic movement, which is powered by a rotor that bears the words ‘Wright Flyer’, the initials of the Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville, and a delightful propellor design. This hugely collectible watch, with a 50-hour power reserve, is one of just 300 pieces.

                            Still based in the alpine village of Le Locle where it was founded in 1865, Zenith has become inseparably associated with pioneering aviation watches. In 1909, father of aviation Louis Blériot wore a Zenith timepiece when he became the first man to fly the English Channel—in many respects, the DNA of that original pilot's watch has changed little. The Montre d'Aeronef watch itself was born in the 1930s as a cockpit clock, a vital tool for pilots through many generations. This modern example uses many design elements from these historic timepieces with very few changes—although it is, of course, equipped with a superb modern, in-house Elite movement complete with a classic GMT complication. How better to capture Zenith's extraordinary legacy of horology for pilots?

                            Before the legendary Calibre 360, which made headlines as the first mechanical chronograph movement capable of measuring hundredths of a second, there was the Calibre 36. Equally legendary, in its way, it boasts a super-high frequency of 5Hz (most high-end chronographs beat at 4Hz). This might remind you of another famous chronograph movement, and you'd be right: the Calibre 36 is a modified version of Zenith's El Primero—ironic, considering Heuer and Zenith were competitors in the famous 1969 race to build the first automatic chrono—although this one has been upgraded with additional flyback capability. This gorgeous, cutting-edge Carrera has been called the “hero model” of the Calibre 36 range, thanks to its titanium case and sleek black titanium carbide exterior.

                            This magnificent pilot's timepiece from top Swiss brand IWC features a very special complication. The world timer is widely considered the cream of luxury travelling watches. Rather than simply adding an extra hand to show a second time zone, the watch features a somewhat more complex—yet intuitive and satisfying—operation. The time in the home city is shown by the primary hands on the dial, while the wearer can simultaneously see the time in every major city around the world by the position of the rotating 24-hour disk between the city names and the main dial (conveniently distinguishing between day and night).

                            This magnificent pilot's timepiece from top Swiss brand IWC features a very special complication. The world timer is widely considered the cream of luxury travelling watches. Rather than simply adding an extra hand to show a second time zone, the watch features a somewhat more complex—yet intuitive and satisfying—operation. The time in the home city is shown by the primary hands on the dial, while the wearer can simultaneously see the time in every major city around the world by the position of the rotating 24-hour disk between the city names and the main dial (conveniently distinguishing between day and night). In this supremely well engineered and finished example, the cities themselves do not move, allowing the wearer to get used to looking for them always in the same place.

                            This gorgeous black Luminor is one of a limited run with reference PAM 508. The 508 is significant for being the first Luminor Submersible with a ceramic case, made from zirconium oxide with an added heat-resistant pigment that provides the deep black colouring. A sandblasted finishing creates the matt appearance. The result is incredibly hard, lightweight and scratch-resistant, and looks amazing in its imposing 47mm form. The black leather strap completes the look. The watch runs on the in-house P.9000 movement, which boasts a 3-day power reserve from two barrels, and allows the wearer to change the time in convenient 1-hour increments.

                            First held in 2009, the Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo is a series of motor racing tournaments held around the world, in which amateur and pro-amateur drivers compete using Lamborghini Cup cars. The event is an exclusive showcase of the alliance between these two giants of the luxury industry, sharing their passion for superlative aesthetics and technology. Aiming to match the quality and style of the prestigious Gallardo cars created for the race, Blancpain unveiled this extra special Super Trofeo chronograph. Based on the brand's L-Evolution series, the watch is magnificently sporty and good looking without going over the top, and it houses an exceptionally sophisticated flyback movement.

                            The Speedmaster is so closely associated with NASA and the Moon landings these days that it's easy to forget that when it was first released in the 1950s, it was not remotely intended for space travel. Rather, as the name suggests, the Speedy was designed as a sports watch for timing motor racing and other fast, or indeed furious, events. Today it's very rare to encounter Speedies from the long lost pre-Moon era, but when you do find something like this gorgeous vintage piece from 1967, be sure to snap it up for your collection.

                            Known as one of the foremost purveyors of ultra-elegant jewellery, Cartier has long made superb watches, with excellent mechanical pedigree – but its principal strong suit has been high-fashion and style. The Calibre de Cartier collection represents a big step forward for the brand into the world of true haute horlogerie. Without losing an ounce of its customary sophistication and stylishness, the watches are equipped with the first self-winding movement entirely manufactured by Cartier SA: the glorious 1904 MC (named for the year that Louis Cartier famously made his first timepiece for Alberto Santos-Dumont). You can see it through the sapphire caseback.

                            In 2008, IWC announced a new collection of six vintage revivals, each from a different beloved watch series, to celebrate the 140th anniversary of the prestigious brand's founding in 1868. Each watch was designed and created based on the very first model from their respective family—in the case of this gorgeous Portuguese, this was the original piece from 1939 that began the extraordinary Portuguese legacy of ultra-elegant, high-precision chronometers. While it looks substantially different from today's models, this vintage reincarnation maintains the timeless, uncluttered beauty and sophistication that we still associate with the series.

                            The Air King was named in honour of the brave RAF pilots of WWII, when Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, discovered they were ditching their standard issue watches for his Oyster Perpetual. As one of its longest continuously manufactured and most affordable watches, the Air King is a beloved staple of Rolex's range. At Baselworld 2016, the brand released this superbly updated model. It refreshes the classic look, upgrading size, durability and calibre precision while staying true to its aviation heritage in such key elements as the iconic 1950s Air-King font. Many believe that the dial design is inspired by the custom dashboard timepieces Rolex supplied to the Bloodhound SSC land speed record attempt.

                            Originally introduced in 1956, the Day-Date was the first watch to indicate the day of the week spelt out in full when it was launched, making it an innovative piece. In 2008, Rolex released the Day-Date II, a modern update of the timelessly classic Day-Date, which features a larger case than the original watch. However, this has since been replaced by the Day-Date 40, introduced back in 2015. This Day-Date II, then, features a rose gold bracelet, fluted bezel and case, both effortlessly paired with the black baton dial that features baguette-cut diamond and ruby hour markers. This piece is perfect for those after a little bling, or with a taste for rare and discontinued Rolex models.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This incredible 40mm model in 18k Everose gold features a spellbinding sunburst dial that stands out beautifully within the black bezel. Presented on a black rubber Oysterflex bracelet, this is a spectacular timepiece that is currently one of the most sought-after watches around.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            The Rolex Explorer is one of the most highly valued and sought out models for buyers with a lot of experience in the often complicated world of vintage watch collecting. Originally based on the model worn by Tenzing Norgay in the first ever successful ascent of Everest in 1953, the Explorer was a versatile timepiece that enjoyed numerous variations. This reference 14270 is an excellent example. Starting in 1989, it brought a well-received modern upgrade to the Explorer family, while staying faithful to the original model—and also introduced the superb calibre 3000.

                            Like many of its iconic watch families, Rolex's Milgauss was created in 1956 with a specific market in mind: scientists, power station workers and anyone else exposed to high magnetic fields. It was designed to be able to resist fields up to 1,000 gauss (hence the name—“mille” is Latin for thousand). The watch built a solid reputation with only two models until 1988, and was happily revived two decades later in a modern re-edition that remains faithful to the original purpose and aesthetics—including the beloved lightning bolt hand. This gorgeous GV version (Glace Verte) has a green-tinted dial crystal, and uses a Parachrom-Blu hairspring for even better magnetic and shock resistance.

                            Having a date indicator on a watch is taken for granted these days, but before 1945, the concept didn't exist at all—until Rolex added a simple, yet game-changing element to their famous Oyster watch: the date window. This small aperture changed the role of wristwatches from mere timekeeping devices to calendars as well. The Datejust was (and is) known for its classic elegance—the watch is striking in its magnificent, minimalist beauty. This delightful 'mid-size' model, which comes in a variety of dial colours and materials, is intended for use by both men and women.

                            The Seamaster is one of the most iconic diving watches of all time. Following Omega's Marine in 1932, the world's first commercially available diving watch, the legend of the Seamaster officially debuted in 1948. By the time of 1957's 300M, it was among the most dependable and professionally sought dive watches from any brand, and it soon pioneered some of the sporty must-have features we associate with such watches, including unidirectional bezels, phosphorescent hands and the helium escape valve. This excellent example takes the familiar technical specs and design cues and updates them with a stunning chronograph dial featuring sporty red highlights.

                            This exceptional limited edition Panerai honours the incredible, record-setting expedition by legendary South African explorer Mike Horn to the North Pole in 2006. It was the first time anyone had reached the pole without dogs or motorised transport; they went on skis or foot in total darkness for 60 days. This watch, which boasts the expedition's route map and Horn's signature engraved on the caseback, is a very special Luminor. It uses an advanced type of lubricant to prevent it freezing up in arctic conditions, and also features inner protection made of soft iron to make it resistant to magnetic fields.

                            This is a rare opportunity to own a truly remarkable version of the iconic Rolex Submariner. The LB (“lunette bleu”) watch features a dazzling blue bezel and dial on top of all that lovely Rolex design and prestige—and best of all, it comes in a gorgeous white gold case. The Submariner is one of the greatest legends in the world of watches, perhaps ever. Developed with Jacques-Yves Cousteau in 1953, it quickly became the quintessential diver's watch, a reputation only cemented by appearances in the early Bond films. Today, its timeless design and unbeatable mechanical pedigree continue to make it one of the brand's best-selling pieces.

                            In 2008, Rolex released the Day-Date II, a modern update of the timelessly classic Day-Date, which features a larger case (41mm) than the original. This in turn was replaced in 2015 by the Day-Date 40 which, as the name implies, comes in a 40mm case. This version in white gold features a signature fluted bezel, within which is a sublime dark green dial bearing applied Roman numerals. The date at 3 o’clock lies beneath the signature Rolex Cyclops magnifying lens for better legibility. It comes on a President bracelet and runs on the Caliber 3255 automatic movement. Famously, the Day-Date was the first watch to indicate the day of the week spelt out in full when it was launched in 1956, and it has gone on to be worn by everyone from the Dalai Lama to numerous US presidents, hence its ‘President’ nickname.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This incredible 40mm model in 18ct yellow gold features a spellbinding dark green dial that stands out beautifully within the gold bezel. It’s a spectacular timepiece that is currently one of the most sought-after models around.

                            Describing its aesthetic as elegant, simple and creative, Vacheron Constantin has continually aimed to enhance and reinvent the art of fine watchmaking since its introduction over 265 years ago. The oldest Swiss watchmakers in continuous operation, it has cemented its place within the top three watchmakers in the world. Encapsulating that aesthetic, this 18-karat gold piece boasts an array of features on its dial. These comprise a leap year indicator between 1 and 2 o'clock, 30-minute recorder at 3 o'clock, date and moon phase display at 6 o'clock, small seconds at 9 o'clock and day and month windows at 12 o'clock. The manual wind movement—the Vacheron Constantin Calibre 1141 QP—is also perfectly displayed through the open case back. This watch is perfect for those after a timepiece packed full of features from one of the world’s best watchmakers.

                            The Ballon Bleu, one of Cartier's newest watch collections, has been hugely successful since its 2007 release. With a unique, curving, organic case, a cleverly integrated sapphire crown and a multi-facetted guilloché dial, the watch can rightly be called a gem in every sense, blending the best of classical elegance and futuristic originality. Creating beauty through simplicity, the watch showcases everything that makes Cartier such a prestigious and highly-sought brand. This model uses a superb Swiss automatic movement underneath the traditional Roman numerals and blue sword hands on the dial. It's a timepiece that has to been seen in the flesh to get the full effect.

                            The Air King was named in honour of the brave RAF pilots of WWII, when Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, discovered they were ditching their standard issue watches for his Oyster Perpetual. As one of its longest continuously manufactured and most affordable watches, the Air King is a beloved staple of Rolex's range. At Baselworld 2016, the brand released this superbly updated model. It refreshes the classic look, upgrading size, durability and calibre precision while staying true to its aviation heritage in such key elements as the iconic 1950s Air-King font. Many believe that the dial design is inspired by the custom dashboard timepieces Rolex supplied to the Bloodhound SSC land speed record attempt.

                            The Yacht-Master was originally introduced by Rolex in 1992—the first all-new model from the brand since the Daytona in 1964. The watch was designed for adventurers and sportsmen, like the topside equivalent of the diver's Submariner, to which it bears certain similarities. This version updates the classic model with extraordinary new materials. The bezel is black ceramic, the case is glorious 'Everose' gold (a unique Rolex alloy), and perhaps most exciting of all, the strap is made of rubber—a major first for Rolex—that the brand is calling 'Oysterflex'. In fact, it's not natural rubber but a special material known as elastomer. Inside, you'll find the stunning calibre 3135.

                            This watch is not just a classic Submariner—one of the most popular and iconic watches in the world—but a striking and highly collectible variant edition. The watch is easily recognisable thanks to its rare green bezel and dial, causing collectors to give it the affectionate nickname “Hulk”, although LV itself stands for Lunette Vert (“Green Bezel”). This larger version updates the previous LV model ref 16610 (called “Kermit”) that was originally introduced in 2003 for the 50th anniversary of the Submariner. This edition boasts ceramic inserts in the bezel, with numerals in platinum.

                            The Daytona features on the must-have list of pretty much every watch enthusiast out there, and what better way is there to enjoy the clean lines and classic design of this Rolex icon than with the added warmth that gold brings? Not only that, but this is one of the last Daytonas to feature the modified Zenith El Primero movement, Calibre 4030 (distinguished by the seconds hand at 9 o'clock rather than 6). This movement is proving to be very popular with collectors and is holding its value well.

                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            The Cartier Tank has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design—inspired by the shape of a tank—that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 44mm sports watch in striking monochrome.

                            This wonderful black dial Luminor features striking white displays for small seconds and – more unusually – the power reserve. The Luminor design originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military-only contractor. It somewhat modernised the Panerai look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the distinctive cushion case, and a crown guard to boost water resistance. This model has a lightweight titanium case with a depth rating of 300m, and is powered by the OP IX movement.

                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 44mm sports watch in striking monochrome.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            This extraordinary limited edition is an almost exact reissue of the iconic first watch made by Officine Panerai in 1936 for the Royal Italian Navy. At that time, Panerai was making technical instruments (depth gauges, compasses, even torpedo launchers) but not watches. To make the watch, it bought cushion cases, purely because they were popular at the time, and movements from Rolex. It added a new Panerai invention: radiomir, a luminous material to make the watches legible in the dark. The watch was so well made that it passed all the military tests with flying colours, and has remained a legend in Panerai history ever since. There are no brand markings on the famous California dial in order to prevent the enemy discovering the navy's supplier, should the watch fall into the wrong hands.

                            The Air King was named in honour of the brave RAF pilots of WWII, when Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, discovered they were ditching their standard issue watches for his Oyster Perpetual. As one of its longest continuously manufactured and most affordable watches, the Air King is a beloved staple of Rolex's range. At Baselworld 2016, the brand released this superbly updated model. It refreshes the classic look, upgrading size, durability and calibre precision while staying true to its aviation heritage in such key elements as the iconic 1950s Air-King font. Many believe that the dial design is inspired by the custom dashboard timepieces Rolex supplied to the Bloodhound SSC land speed record attempt.

                            When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the summit of Everest in 1953, their expedition team were supplied with watches by Rolex and the British company Smith’s. Rolex designed a watch specifically for the expedition, which came to be known as the Explorer, one of the less prominent models in the Rolex stable but one that has been a constant since its launch. A far plainer looking watch back then, the Explorer aesthetic is now characterised by the Mercedes hour hand, three-quarter numeral black dial and Oyster bracelet. This model, with a 36mm case, is the first to come in two-tone steel and yellow gold and runs on a Caliber 3230 which holds a power reserve of almost 70 hours.

                            Panerai has several watches with amazingly long power reserves, yet even by its standards, this 8-day Radiomir is pretty darn cool. The watch harnesses three large mainspring barrels to generate this much power, and the superb mechanical specs of the in-house P.2002 movement ensure that this energy is distributed cleanly and evenly without any compromise of timekeeping precision. In addition to the power reserve, which has a 'linear' display at 6 o'clock, the watch also boasts a stunning black aesthetic made possible by the extraordinary ceramic case material, formed from the isostatic pressing of zirconium oxide.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This incredible 40mm model in 18k Everose gold features a spellbinding sunburst dial that stands out beautifully within the black bezel. Presented on a black rubber Oysterflex bracelet, this is a spectacular timepiece that is currently one of the most sought-after watches around.

                            The El Primero legend is one of the great stories of 20th century watchmaking. Invented in 1969, it represented the end of an intense race between three major horological research teams to create the world's first automatic chronograph; a race that many believe it won. Today, the El Primero remains one of the most highly regarded movements in the world, and one of only a small number to use the stunning frequency of 5Hz for maximum precision. The marvellous timepiece for sale here allows you to keep an eye on this superb piece of horological history with a partially skeletonised dial that shows the escapement (and small seconds) in a cutaway at 10 o'clock. There's also a useful power reserve complication at 6 o'clock.

                            The Royal Oak is one of the most iconic watches in history – a product of the same genius designer, Gerald Genta, who was responsible for the likes of Patek Philippe's Nautilus and IWC's Ingenieur. The story is a dramatic one – Audemars Piguet had been lingering on the edge of collapse since the Great Depression, but the Royal Oak's unprecedentedly bold lines, steel case and luxury pricing turned Genta's creation into an enormous success that saved the prestigious company. Since then, the legendary watch has gone from strength to strength, and continues to serve as a key showcase for the best elements of the brand's historic and peerless watchmaking abilities.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they are among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79240, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            Panerai watches tend to follow certain conventions and design codes that make them instantly recognisable – but some watches move away from this formula, providing a welcome breath of fresh air. And few Panerai models have left the beaten track as much as the FER00003, the third watch from the brand's short-lived partnership with Ferrari. It's still got the distinctive cushion case shape, but other than that, there's little that says “Panerai” here – even the crown guard has been removed. Despite this, the Ferrari watches are lovely timepieces in their own right, and they possess the enviable combination of being both rare and relatively affordable. Indeed, unlike the first two Ferrari watches, this is a strictly limited edition.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            When Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the lunar module, codenamed ‘Eagle’, and onto the powdery surface of the moon, the Omega Speedmaster on his wrist became the legendary Moonwatch. Tested to the limits by NASA for the rigours of space flight, the Speedmaster had in fact been into space before the testing had even begun. In October 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra took his own personal Speedmaster on board Sigma 7 and orbited Earth a total of six times for the Mercury 7 mission. The Speedmaster continued to provide NASA astronauts with invaluable service for the Apollo 13 mission, when it was used to time the crucial burn that would return the astronauts safely to Earth.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This Daytona flaunts an uber-cool meteorite dial—no two are the same— which perfectly complements the white gold case and burgundy alligator strap. This is an ideal timepiece for those after a classic Rolex with a bit of pizazz.

                            The IWC Portuguese Laureus Sport for Good Foundation prominently features a galvanised blue dial that goes perfectly with the alligator strap. Limited to 2,000 pieces, this watch was made to raise money for the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, a charity that helps disadvantaged children through sports programs – proceeds from each watch were donated to the foundation. IWC makes a Limited Edition Laureus watch every year, always featuring the foundation's “colour of hope” (blue) and a caseback engraving of a child’s drawing, the winner of a themed annual competition. These watches have become highly collectable for fans of IWC.

                            Sleek, menacing and black as night, the PAM 438's dark allure is not the result of any external PVD or DLC. Dubbed the “Tuttonero” (from the Italian for All Black), it's a fully ceramic case, much harder than steel and amazingly durable, the result of an exceptionally long and high-tech process to achieve the gorgeous matte finish. The Tuttonero name is not an exaggeration—it's not just the case that's black. The entire strap is made from the same ceramic, and even the beautiful in-house P.9001 movement has undergone a blackening process to achieve a uniform look. It also has an impressive power reserve of three days and features a GMT complication.

                            The Royal Oak is one of the most iconic watches in history – a product of Gerald Genta, the same genius designer who was responsible for the likes of Patek Philippe's Nautilus and IWC's Ingenieur. The story is quite dramatic – Audemars Piguet had been lingering on the edge of collapse since the Depression, but the unprecedentedly bold lines, steel case and luxury pricing turned Genta's creation into an enormous success that saved the prestigious company. The Offshore collection, meanwhile, was designed by Emmanuel Gueit in 1993, and represents the next step in the evolution of the brand's signature creation. While sticking to the classic elements of the original Royal Oak, the Offshore takes its bold nature even further.

                            Created by Gerald Genta and like many of his famous watches, the Nautilus is a horological legend. Patek Philippe's most well known and desirable sports watch, it's celebrated for some of the best examples of emblematic Genta trademarks: large, angular bezel, comparatively thin case, integrated bracelet and bold, if straightforward, dial. The design is based on the traditional shape of portholes, up to and including the hinges often found on the sides—hence the Nautilus' unmistakable 'ears'. This model brings extra appeal in the form of a stunning movement with several additional complications: a small seconds, a power reserve indicator, and most impressively, a combined date and moonphase display.

                            Many Panerai watches were made in relatively small production runs, but it's much more rare to find models that are officially limited. The PAM 005 represents just such a limited edition, and at a comparatively reasonable price. The watch is a close cousin of the beloved 000 “Base”, featuring the same desirable logo dial and painted numerals, which many collectors prefer to the classic “sandwich” dials (like the PAM 111, another close relative of the 005). This is a beautiful Luminor Marina with superb luminova, an understated small seconds subdial, and a gorgeous, COSC-certified movement.

                            When Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the lunar module, codenamed ‘Eagle’, and onto the powdery surface of the moon, the Omega Speedmaster on his wrist became the legendary Moonwatch. Tested to the limits by NASA for the rigours of space flight, the Speedmaster had in fact been into space before the testing had even begun. In October 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra took his own personal Speedmaster on board Sigma 7 and orbited Earth a total of six times for the Mercury 7 mission. The Speedmaster continued to provide NASA astronauts with invaluable service for the Apollo 13 mission, when it was used to time the crucial burn that would return the astronauts safely to Earth.

                            Named after the speedway track in Florida that hosts a legendary, Rolex-sponsored twenty-four hour race, the Daytona is the quintessential driver’s watch and was given a boost in popularity when Hollywood icon Paul Newman wore an early version of it. The dial, with its three subdials, is clear and easy to read while a tachymeter on the bezel offers quick speed calculations. It’s powered by Rolex’s Caliber 4130 automatic chronograph movement which holds a power reserve of 72 hours. Introduced in 1963 it’s been in continuous production ever since, although this particular reference is discontinued. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit.

                            The Luminor design originated in the early 1950s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market—though it remained firmly rooted in the look and feel of the military watches of the '30s and '40s when the company was born. The new watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, with a clear and legible dial boasting stunning luminova indices and hands.

                            Tudor has stepped out of the shadow of its older sister brand Rolex in recent years, offering watches that feature some of the hallmarks of its more illustrious sibling but at a more accessible price point. It forged its distinct personality largely by delving into its archives and reviving old models, including the Pelagos, a version of a Tudor Submariner from the 1970s. This model is powered by an MT5612 in-house calibre, which replaced the ETA movement of previous Pelagos models. It bears the now-iconic Tudor ‘snowflake’ hands, echoed in the square indexes, and the date is displayed in the window at 3 o’clock. The 42mm case is a blend of steel and titanium, while the bezel—also titanium—is coated in matt black ceramic. A handsome and versatile divers’ watch, it is water resistant to 500 metres, boasts a helium escape valve at 9 o’clock and holds a 70-hour power reserve.

                            This vintage-looking Seamaster 300 is a 60th Anniversary tribute to one of three classic timepieces released in 1957. Like all three watches in the trilogy, it is cased in brushed and polished stainless steel and features a beautiful black 'tropical' dial, with deepened dagger indexes filled with aged-looking Super-LumiNova, enhancing the retro aesthetic. The arrow hour hand is also delightfully retro, and is something shared by Omega’s collectible Ranchero model. It also bears an engraving of the 1957 Seahorse on the caseback. Limited to just 3,557 pieces, it is powered by the self-winding Master Chronometer 8806, featuring the lubricant-free co-axial escapement invented by the illustrious English horologist George Daniels. The power reserve is 55 hours and it is water-resistant to 200 metres.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 divers conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its unidirectional bezel, exceptionally legible design and superb finishing and craftsmanship. The piece maintains an excellent 300 meter water resistance, protecting the TAG Heuer Calibre 5 inside.

                            When Patek Philippe released the Aquanaut in 1997 it was considered part of the Gerald Genta-designed Nautilus collection and shared some of its famous design elements, including the rounded octagonal bezel that drew inspiration from a porthole. It was also the first Patek Philippe to come on a rubber strap. Having branched off from the Nautilus family and gone its own way, it’s now a popular watch within the brand’s catalogue and is perhaps its sportiest model, combining a dynamic and compact design with casual elegance. This flyback chronograph model is the first of its kind in white gold and pairs a gradient blue ‘grenade’ pattern dial with midnight-blue rubber strap. The sub-dial at 6 o’clock comprises the 60-minute counter and there’s a date aperture at 3 o’clock. It runs on the automatic Caliber CH 28-520 S C which holds a power reserve of up to 45 hours and is visible through the case back, revealing the 21k gold rotor engraved with the brand’s Calatrava cross. This is a versatile luxury sports watch that has seen its demand soar in recent years.

                            Created by Gerald Genta—and like many of his famous watches—the Nautilus is a horological legend. By far Patek Philippe's best known and most desirable sports watch, it's renowned for some of the best examples of emblematic Genta trademarks, large, angular bezel, comparatively thin case, integrated bracelet and bold, if simple, dial. The design is based on the traditional shape of portholes, up to and including the hinges often found on the sides—hence the Nautilus' unmistakable “ears”. This new example is particularly interesting for its unusual white dial that uses strong black borders on the hands and indexes to maintain the high contrast legibility we're used to, while adding a sporty new flavour.

                            Named after the speedway track in Florida that hosts a legendary, Rolex-sponsored twenty-four hour race, the Daytona is the quintessential driver’s watch and was given a boost in popularity when Hollywood icon Paul Newman wore an early version of it. The dial, with its three subdials, is clear and easy to read while a tachymeter on the bezel offers quick speed calculations. It’s powered by Rolex’s Caliber 4130 automatic chronograph movement which holds a power reserve of 72 hours. Introduced in 1963 it’s been in continuous production ever since, although this particular reference is discontinued. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit.

                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            The Luminor 127 is a unique and very special watch in the Panerai pantheon, one close to the hearts of many collectors and affectionately nicknamed the “Fiddy”. First released in 2002, it is an uncanny recreation of a gorgeous vintage timepiece from 1950 (hence the limited edition number), and is known for many important features. For a start, it is 47mm in diameter, a large size with which the brand would subsequently become associated (some claim that Panerai were the ones who launched the whole oversize trend). Then there's the unique form of sandwich dial, rarely seen before, which combined with the crown guard and domed sapphire crystal to create an extremely cool aura of vintage Italian style—one that few others have achieved.

                            This beautiful dress watch from Jaeger-LeCoultre is not just exceptionally well-designed, with a clean, easily readable face and gorgeous case proportions, it also represents phenomenal value for money on its movement, which features several intricate complications. The watch, released in 2014 and inspired by a vintage 1945 piece from the JLC archives, has a moonphase and a complete calendar with displays for date, day of the week, and month. With all this, it still manages to maintain a refined, minimalist aesthetic based around a highly uncluttered dial—in large part thanks to the uncommon pointer-type date display around the dial's circumference.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with high quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage while daring to forge its own path, boasting an energetic modern design with classic racing-red highlights, along with superb finishing and the excellent calibre 16 inside.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, continuing Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense 'Carrera Panamerica' road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera has long been sought to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams. This addition to the Carrera collection fully embodies that racing heritage with its large 60-second chronograph counter, as well as racing-themed colouring and tachymeter scale on the bezel.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 divers conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its unidirectional bezel, exceptionally legible design and superb finishing and craftsmanship. The piece maintains an excellent 300 meter water resistance, protecting the TAG Heuer Calibre 5 inside.

                            The Ballon Bleu, one of Cartier's newest watch collections, has been hugely successful since its 2007 release. With a unique, curving, organic case, a cleverly integrated sapphire crown and a multi-facetted guilloché dial, the watch can rightly be called a gem in every sense, blending the best of classical elegance and futuristic originality. Creating beauty through simplicity, the watch showcases everything that makes Cartier such a prestigious and highly-sought brand. This model uses a superb Swiss automatic movement underneath the traditional Roman numerals and blue sword hands on the dial. It's a timepiece that has to been seen in the flesh to get the full effect.

                            The Yacht-Master was originally introduced by Rolex in 1992—the first all-new model from the brand since the Daytona in 1964. The watch was designed for adventurers and sportsmen, like the topside equivalent of the diver's Submariner, to which it bears certain similarities. This version updates the classic model with extraordinary new materials. The bezel is black ceramic, the case is glorious 'Everose' gold (a unique Rolex alloy), and perhaps most exciting of all, the strap is made of rubber—a major first for Rolex—that the brand is calling 'Oysterflex'. In fact, it's not natural rubber but a special material known as elastomer. Inside, you'll find the stunning calibre 3135.

                            It's rare for Rolex to create completely new watch collections, but this is what happened in 2012 with the exceptional Sky-Dweller. It's not just the design that's new—the watch also features a complication never seen in a Rolex watch before, the annual calendar. This difficult mechanical addition has been ever-so-subtly integrated. The main way you will even notice it is when the date magically jumps after months with only 30 days. There's also a small indicator next to each hour marker; the white one shows the current month. This would all be remarkable in itself, but it's arguably overshadowed by the innovative new GMT display, occupying much of the central dial, and the even more innovative bezel. The latter has been upgraded with a “Ring Command” function that allows you to set the time and the other complications in a simple, intuitive fashion.

                            For many, Patek Philippe will always be the ultimate brand of the dress watch. The ancient and incredibly prestigious firm may be best remembered for its haute horlogerie elegance, but one mustn't forget its equal mastery in the realm of sports watches. And we don't just mean the Nautilus, which has been the iconic go-to Patek for many decades. Many collectors have realised that its younger brother, the wonderful Aquanaut, fulfils most of the same sterling credentials at a lower price. This model, the brand's most recent, is a particularly fine example, and features the extraordinary in-house movement 324 SC.

                            Like many of its iconic watch families, Rolex's Milgauss was created in 1956 with a specific market in mind: scientists, power station workers and anyone else exposed to high magnetic fields. It was designed to be able to resist fields up to 1,000 gauss (hence the name—“mille” is Latin for thousand). The watch built a solid reputation with only two models until 1988, and was happily revived two decades later in a modern re-edition that remains faithful to the original purpose and aesthetics—including the beloved lightning bolt hand. This gorgeous GV version (Glace Verte) has a green-tinted dial crystal, and uses a Parachrom-Blu hairspring for even better magnetic and shock resistance.

                            This watch is not just a classic Submariner—one of the most popular and iconic watches in the world—but a striking and highly collectible variant edition. The watch is easily recognisable thanks to its rare green bezel and dial, causing collectors to give it the affectionate nickname “Hulk”, although LV itself stands for Lunette Vert (“Green Bezel”). This larger version updates the previous LV model ref 16610 (called “Kermit”) that was originally introduced in 2003 for the 50th anniversary of the Submariner. This edition boasts ceramic inserts in the bezel, with numerals in platinum.

                            This exceptional chronograph from the Master Compressor collection of Jaeger-LeCoultre, one of Switzerland's most prestigious and desirable watch brands, has many stand-out features. The energetic-yet-elegant, red, white and black design is immediately attention grabbing, and closer inspection only reveals yet greater marvels. The watch is fitted with one of the first examples of JLC's cutting-edge shock absorbing system, using an air cushion to protect the exquisitely engineered movement. Calibre 752 is one of the brand's first in-house automatic chronographs, and uses a vertical coupling system for extreme precision. This example is even more remarkable for its extra complications, including the stunning world timer, showing the time in all 24 zones simultaneously.

                            Partnering with one of the biggest American companies of the last century, Pan American Airways, Rolex created a watch that was capable of telling the time in more than one place or time zone—the GMT-Master. In 1983 the updated GMT-Master II was released, gaining the nickname “The Fat Lady” due to its chunky case. Later, in 2005, Rolex redesigned and rereleased the GMT-Master on its 50th anniversary by launching the GMT-Master II. This new release became the first Rolex sport watch with the new, larger case and ceramic bezel—famed for its scratch resistance and immunity to fading. Its updated 3186 calibre boasted some improvements compared to the older 3185, making the hour hand a lot easier to set. It also featured a new hairspring which was a lot less sensitive to temperature changes and magnetism—perfect for flying and travelling, just as the original intended. This special GMT-Master II—made of white gold—is the sequel to the watch that introduced the much-anticipated Pepsi ceramic bezel, now coming with a blue dial instead of white, for this second generation run.

                            This technically superlative Ingenieur from IWC features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph, one of the most difficult and challenging mechanical complications in high-end watchmaking. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden behind the other; an extra pusher at 10 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other seconds hand continues to run. As well as being mechanically impressive, this Double Chrono is also an imposing wear, with a large titanium case and bezel, five ceramic screws and a rubber-coated crown and pushers—all materials inspired by IWC's partnership with the Mercedes Formula One team.

                            Expanding on their hugely admired Heritage Black Bay series, Tudor released its Black Bay Fifty-Eight in 2018, inspired by the brand’s reference 7924 Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1958—hence the name. Previously released Black Bays, still in production, had bigger cases—41mm, or even 43mm for the bronze model—but at 39mm the Black Bay Fifty-Eight is noticeably smaller and will suit those with a smaller wrist. A classic steel dive watch with a retro feel, including the faux-aged lume and distinctive red triangle on the aluminium bezel, this is a COSC-certified chronometer with 200m water resistance and an in-house movement—unlike the earliest Black Bays. Increasingly sought-after, this is a future classic that has further enhanced Tudor’s reputation and allowed it to step out of the shadow of its older sibling, Rolex.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 448 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, authentic black dial and the blue hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            Tudor has stepped out of the shadow of its older sister brand Rolex in recent years, offering watches that feature some of the hallmarks of its more illustrious sibling but at a more accessible price point. It forged its distinct personality largely by delving into its archives and reviving old models, including the Pelagos, a version of a Tudor Submariner from the 1970s. This left-hand winder is powered by an MT5612 in-house calibre, which replaced the ETA movement of previous Pelagos models. It bears the now-iconic Tudor ‘snowflake’ hands, echoed in the square indexes, and the date is displayed in the window at 3 o’clock. The 42mm case is a blend of steel and titanium, while the bezel—also titanium—is coated in matt black ceramic. A handsome and versatile divers’ watch, it is water resistant to 500 metres, boasts a helium escape valve at 3 o’clock and holds a 70-hour power reserve.

                            While this “Deep Two” watch is not the first IWC to feature a mechanical depth gauge—one of the most extraordinary complications you can find in a dive watch—it represents an evolution of the brand's previous model. The second generation of this super-practical diving family, the Deep Two can measure your current depth (up to 50 meters) as well as your max depth on a particular dive. The intuitive display functions more or less as a complete dive computer that can be used for any underwater calculations a diver needs to make. With excellent water- and shock-resistance, this is the ultimate tool for serious divers and horological enthusiasts alike.

                            The brainchild of legendary watch designer Gerald Genta, the Nautilus was introduced in 1976 to compete with Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak, another now-iconic Genta-designed steel sports watch launched a few years earlier. Its case shape, with ear-like projections either side, was like nothing the industry had seen before and despite not being an immediate hit it’s now one of the most sought-after Patek models around, particularly the 5711 model which was discontinued in 2021. This version in 18ct rose gold features the signature horizontally embossed dial in a rich chocolate brown with rose gold hands and applied hour markers. The date window at 3 o'clock  is also framed with a rose gold border. This magnificent piece is powered by the automatic Caliber 324 S C which holds a power reserve of up to 45 hours. The movement is visible through the caseback, revealing the 21k gold rotor engraved with the brand’s Calatrava cross and decorated with côte de Genève stripes. This is a truly outstanding timepiece from the world's most illustrious watchmaker.

                            Released in 1953, the same year as the Submariner, Blancpain’s Fifty Fathoms was the brand’s first ever dive watch and was the result of a request by Captain Bob Maloubier, a British secret agent during World War II who later became leader of the French military’s diving corps. He asked that the watch be as clear as that of a “guiding star for a shepherd” and Blancpain duly delivered with a dial that was highly legible. The first ever Fifty Fathoms, like the first Submariner, was water resistant to 100 metres, but modern versions can withstand 300 metres. This version in a large 45mm, hand-polished rose gold case features a flying, one-minute tourbillon—visible through an aperture in the dial—which also has a pointed arm that serves as a small-seconds hand. The power reserve is 168 hours and the amount of reserve is shown via the display above 6 o’clock. Through the exhibition caseback is displayed the Caliber 25A automatic movement with skeletonised rotor. This is an exceptional version of an iconic dive watch from Switzerland’s oldest watchmaker.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade “superalloy” steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. The LN moniker stands for Lunette Noir—signifying that it uses an all-black bezel.

                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            The Ballon Bleu, one of Cartier's newest watch collections, has been hugely successful since its 2007 release. With a unique, curving, organic case, a cleverly integrated sapphire crown and a multi-facetted guilloché dial, the watch can rightly be called a gem in every sense, blending the best of classical elegance and futuristic originality. Creating beauty through simplicity, the watch showcases everything that makes Cartier such a prestigious and highly-sought brand. This model uses a superb Swiss automatic movement underneath the traditional Roman numerals and blue sword hands on the dial. It's a timepiece that has to been seen in the flesh to get the full effect.

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. The watch builds on the heritage of the legendary Explorer I, which has always been a firm favourite among enthusiasts—the watch was first established in the public mind after its pioneering ascent of Everest during the expedition of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Today the Explorer II deviates in some ways from the original look, but it continues to represent an exceptional, hardy, modernised tool watch with a top-of-the-range in-house movement and a design that does justice to its legacy in both sports and adventure.

                            Just like the Sea-Dweller, the Sky-Dweller is purpose-built for the elements—no surprises which element here. Custom made for the skies and pilots this watch, first released at Baselworld in 2012, will see you soaring through the air in style with its crisp white dial and yellow gold fluted bezel and case and the black rubber bracelet. Inside, the 326238 features the calibre 9001, a superlative performer from Rolex that is one of its most complex in-house movements to date. Featuring the Sky-Dweller’s famed second time zone display on the dial, as well as an annual calendar with date and month display, this piece is as useful as it is stunning—making it perfect for jetsetters and those leading a busy lifestyle.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This white gold Daytona flaunts a stunning dial with a deep blue hue and white hour markers and branding, giving it an appealing understated look that oozes effortless cool.

                            The Omega Speedmaster has earned legendary status as the first watch to accompany NASA astronauts to the Moon. There are now countless variations of this timepiece but easily among the most collectible are the prized Snoopy limited editions. Presented by NASA to Omega in 1970, the Silver Snoopy Award was given to the brand for its contributions to “the success of human space flight missions”, while the reason it was named after the famous Peanuts cartoon-strip character was because of its role as an on-board mascot for the astronauts. This model celebrates the 45th anniversary of the award and features a Super-Luminova Snoopy himself on the seconds subdial at 9 o’clock, lying beneath a cartoon ‘thought bubble’ stating ‘Failure is not an option’ – a line from the film Apollo 13. The watch itself features the standard Speedmaster dial layout but in all white, with a black ceramic insert bezel and applique indices. This model, bearing a Snoopy engraving on the caseback, is limited to just 1,970 pieces and is powered by a manual calibre 1861 with 48-hour power reserve.

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. The watch builds on the heritage of the legendary Explorer I, which has always been a firm favourite among enthusiasts—the watch was first established in the public mind after its pioneering ascent of Everest during the expedition of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Today the Explorer II deviates in some ways from the original look, but it continues to represent an exceptional, hardy, modernised tool watch with a top-of-the-range in-house movement and a design that does justice to its legacy in both sports and adventure.

                            This masterful Radiomir from Panerai features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph (also known as a rattrapante), one of the most difficult and challenging mechanical complications in high-end watchmaking. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden; an extra pusher at 8 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other hand continues to run. The PAM 214 uses the OP XVIII movement, based on a stunning and unusual column wheel Valjoux.

                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. These watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, staying remarkably true to its historic legacy.

                            Sleek, menacing and black as night, the PAM 441's dark allure is not the result of any external PVD or DLC. It's a fully ceramic case, much harder than steel and amazingly durable, the result of an exceptionally long and arduous process of diamond-wheel machining and microglass blasting to achieve the gorgeous matt finish. The material is too hard to mould and is originally created by extreme isostatic pressing of zirconium oxide followed by sintering at around 1,500°C. The beautiful in-house P.9000 movement has an impressive power reserve of three days and also features a GMT complication.

                            Although best known for its Reverso collection, Jaeger-LeCoultre is one of a handful of Swiss bands consistently producing watches with high-prestige complications, such as tourbillons and perpetual calendars. This particular model is one of the highlights of its Master series, a stunning, open-face minute repeater in 18k rose gold with both power reserve and torque indicators on the left and right of the dial, respectively. Unusual for minute repeaters, which rely on a ‘closed’ watch to help amplify the sounds of the gongs, this is an open-face dial, allowing a rare view of this enchanting mechanism, which innovates by having the chiming gongs fused to the crystal. Limited to just 175 pieces, this discontinued watch, a hand-winder with sapphire caseback, is an exceptional piece and justifies JLC’s status as the ‘Watchmaker’s watchmaker’.

                            Designed by Emmanuelle Gueit to celebrate twenty years since the 1972 release of its now-iconic older brother, the Royal Oak, the Offshore range is said to have influenced the trend for oversized watches that began in the mid 1990s. Despite being very similar to its forebear, designed by Gerald Genta, the Royal Oak Offshore is bigger and bolder, often paired with tough rubber straps. This particular limited edition chronograph model comes in 18k rose gold, with rose gold Arabic numerals and hands on the brown dial which lies within a hefty 48mm case. Besides the three chronograph registers there is a date aperture at 3 o’clock and water resistance is 100 metres. The watch, which comes on a pin-buckle rubber strap, runs on the brand’s in-house self-winding Caliber 3126/3840 which has a power reserve of 55-60 hours. Just 350 pieces of this watch were made.

                            The brainchild of legendary watch designer Gerald Genta, the Nautilus was introduced in 1976 to compete with Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak, another now-iconic Genta-designed steel sports watch launched a few years earlier. Its case shape, with ear-like projections either side, was like nothing the industry had seen before and despite not being an immediate hit it’s now one of the most sought-after Patek models around, particularly the 5711 model which was discontinued in 2021. This version in 18ct rose gold features the signature horizontally embossed dial in a rich chocolate brown with rose gold hands and applied hour markers. The date window at 3 o'clock  is also framed with a rose gold border. This magnificent piece is powered by the automatic Caliber 324 S C which holds a power reserve of up to 45 hours. The movement is visible through the caseback, revealing the 21k gold rotor engraved with the brand’s Calatrava cross and decorated with côte de Genève stripes. This is a truly outstanding timepiece from the world's most illustrious watchmaker.

                            If you're a big fan of Panerai, the legendary Italian watchmaker, chances are you've encountered Paneristi.com, the “unofficial resource” and forum where collectors and enthusiasts meet and discuss everything Panerai-related. In a spectacular gesture of good will towards its loyal supporters, the brand itself agreed to create a very limited run of watches in collaboration with the Paneristi site moderators themselves. PVD case, painted patina dial, OP logo, and even a special caseback inscription that commemorates the forum's 10th anniversary—this is the ultimate Panerai for collectors. Competition to own one couldn't have been more fierce.

                            Named after the speedway track in Florida that hosts a legendary, Rolex-sponsored twenty-four hour race, the Daytona is the quintessential driver’s watch and was given a boost in popularity when Hollywood icon Paul Newman wore an early version of it. The dial, with its three subdials, is clear and easy to read while a tachymeter on the bezel offers quick speed calculations. It’s powered by Rolex’s Caliber 4130 automatic chronograph movement which holds a power reserve of 72 hours. Introduced in 1963 it’s been in continuous production ever since, although this particular reference is discontinued. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors.

                            Many Panerai watches were made in relatively small production runs, but it's much more rare to find models that are officially limited. The PAM 005 represents just such a limited edition, and at a comparatively reasonable price. The watch is a close cousin of the beloved 000 “Base”, featuring the same desirable logo dial and painted numerals, which many collectors prefer to the classic “sandwich” dials (like the PAM 111, another close relative of the 005). This is a beautiful Luminor Marina with superb luminova, an understated small seconds subdial, and a gorgeous, COSC-certified movement.

                            This technically superlative IWC features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph, one of the most difficult and challenging mechanical complications in high-end watchmaking. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden; an extra pusher at 10 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other seconds hand continues to run. The impressive complication is particularly welcome in IWC's wonderful Portuguese collection, long famed for its peerless elegance and classic aesthetics.

                            This exceptional diving watch from the Master Compressor collection of Jaeger-LeCoultre, one of Switzerland's most prestigious and desirable watch brands, has many stand-out features. The energetic-yet-elegant, blue, white and black design is immediately attention grabbing, and closer inspection only reveals yet greater marvels. Calibre 979 features a world timer GMT complication, showing the time in all 24 zones simultaneously, easily adjusted by the crown at 4. The crowns themselves boast an innovative “butterfly collar” design (as opposed to simple screw-down) that ensures water resistance. Most impressive, however, is the rare mechanical depth gauge on the left of the case, with the depth displayed up to 80m by the blue hand from the centre.

                            The Altiplano collection is known for its extraordinary elegance and ultra-thin cases (a recent record-setting watch measured 3.65mm high). This “Double Jeu” model is no exception: while the total thinness is 11.7mm, this is spread across two stunning cases (both in rose gold). The top one flips on a subtly integrated hinge to reveal the second dial, each with its own movement. The lower uses the incredible 830P ultra-thin (just 2.5mm), while the upper has the 838P—the only difference being the small seconds dial and the ability to admire it through the middle caseback. Each dial has its own crown, allowing for multiple timezone settings, while the watch is opened by the latch at 3 o'clock.

                            Audemars Piguet sponsored the Alinghi Team at the world-famous America's Cup for most of the 2000s, including its major wins in 2003 and 2007. This watch was the last of the special editions made in honour of Alinghi, here seen in a stunningly rare and collectible gold version limited to just 600 pieces. The watch boasts a very special ten-minute countdown complication designed especially for use at regattas, and is also notable for being one of the first watches ever to make use of forged carbon in the phenomenal bezel. This cutting-edge material, pioneered by Audemars Piguet, is even stronger and lighter than most kinds of carbon fibres.

                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 44mm sports watch in striking monochrome.

                            As part of the Windrider series, the Cockpit combines the best of Breitling design in a smaller, more elegant case. Many other Breitlings are too large for some people to wear comfortably, so this 41mm case size makes a refreshing change for those who like the brand but don’t want an oversized watch—and the 14mm height is also not unwieldy. Much more rarely encountered on the market than other Breitling watch families, the Cockpit cuts to the core of the brand's aviation-based appeal, while updating the design with the best of modern manufacturing. As with every Breitling, the build quality and finish are fantastic. The gold elements on the case and dial of this model are particularly attractive.

                            The modern Luminor design originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military-only contractor. Three limited edition pieces created at this time set the style for what would soon become modern Luminor. It somewhat modernised the 1940s-era look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the distinctive cushion case, and a crown guard to boost water resistance. This lovely example has an in-house movement, the P.3002, with a power reserve of three days that is displayed in a sophisticated retrograde indicator on the dial.

                            The brainchild of legendary watch designer Gerald Genta, the Nautilus was introduced in 1976 to compete with Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak, another now-iconic Genta-designed steel sports watch launched a few years earlier. Its case shape, with ear-like projections either side, was like nothing the industry had seen before and despite not being an immediate hit it’s now one of the most sought-after Patek models around. The 5990/1A, now discontinued, enhances an already remarkable watch with a host of extremely useful functions, comprising a second time zone—with a day and night indicator for both local and home zones—a date, displayed on the sub dial between 11 and 1 o’clock, subsidiary seconds and a flyback chronograph. Stainless steel, with a horizontally embossed black dial and white gold applied hour markers, it exudes high-end luxury and is powered by the automatic Caliber 28-520 S C FUS which holds a power reserve of 45 hours. The movement is visible through the case back, revealing the 21k gold rotor engraved with the brand’s Calatrava cross and decorated with côte de Genève stripes.

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. Reference 16550 is one of only three Explorer II variants since the first one, and also one of the rarest. It was in production for just one and a half or two years starting in 1985, and offered an improved, simpler look, new dial colours, GMT functionality and the first sapphire crystal in an Explorer.

                            When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the summit of Everest in 1953, their expedition team were supplied with watches by Rolex and the British company Smith’s. Rolex designed a watch specifically for the expedition, which came to be known as the Explorer, one of the less prominent models in the Rolex stable but one that has been a constant since its launch. A far plainer looking watch back then, the Explorer aesthetic is now characterised by the Mercedes hour hand, three-quarter numeral black dial and Oyster bracelet. This model, with a 36mm case, is the first to come in two-tone steel and yellow gold and runs on a Caliber 3230 which holds a power reserve of almost 70 hours.

                            Bremont describes the Supermarine collection as “divers watches inspired by our aviation principles”. This doesn't mean the Supermarine is a pilot's watch, but rather a traditional, good-looking and high-grade diver that is—at heart—a Bremont. Demonstrating the brand's no-nonsense British clarity and effortless sense of refinement, the Supermarine also boasts the impressive technical credentials for which Bremont, a relatively small independent brand, is rightly acclaimed. The watch uses Bremont's anti-shock mount, a Faraday cage and a helium escape valve to make itself seriously durable, with this limited edition further fortified by a DLC coating. Meanwhile, accuracy is guaranteed by the Swiss chronometer inside, lovingly embellished and assembled in Bremont's Henley factory.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            Bremont describes the Supermarine collection as “divers watches inspired by our aviation principles”. This doesn't mean the Supermarine is a pilot's watch, but rather a traditional, good-looking and high-grade diver that is—at heart—a Bremont. Demonstrating the brand's no-nonsense British clarity and effortless sense of refinement, the Supermarine also boasts the impressive technical credentials for which Bremont, a relatively small independent brand, is rightly acclaimed. The watch uses Bremont's anti-shock mount, a Faraday cage and a helium escape valve to make itself seriously durable. Meanwhile, accuracy is guaranteed by the Swiss chronometer inside, lovingly embellished and assembled in Bremont's Henley factory.

                            The watch is limited edition and was created as a tribute to the legendary pilot's watch, the 'Cairelli' CP2 .

This re-edition timepiece stays true to the aesthetic and size of the original CP2, which was first produced for the Italian Air Force in the 1960's, by the watchmaker A.Cairelli. The watch features a bi-directional bezel and lumed hands on a matte black dial, making the piece as functional as a pilots watch as the original timepiece. 

The vintage style pump pushers and applied Zenith pointed star on the dial complete the aesthetic of the piece, an accurate and detailed re-edition of a much loved vintage pilot's watch.

                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            One of the most iconic vintage watches of the 20th century, the Heuer Monaco achieved a legendary status primarily for three reasons: for its innovative, square-cased design; for being the first watch to house the famous calibre 11, one of the very first automatic chronograph movements in history; and for its association with cult actor Steve McQueen, who wore the watch during the filming of the great 1972 motorsports film Le Mans, personifying the timeless cool of the classic race car era. This superb modern Monaco model remains exceptionally faithful to the original style of the watch's heyday.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 diver conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its 300m water resistance, big date and chronograph functionality. Impressively, there's a tenth of a second counter at 6 o'clock, which is testament to the exceptional reliability and accuracy of the caliber inside.

                            There are many travellers watches with GMT complications, but having an alarm function accompanying it on a gorgeous mechanical timepiece like this is considerably more rare. The alarm function has an intuitive setting system via one of the dual crowns, and produces a distinctive buzzing sound. Many watches with an extra time zone display can start to look cluttered, but this phenomenal timepiece retains its stylish Panerai look with a brilliant design that places the GMT indication in a subtle 24-hour wheel window in the bottom of the dial. All this is thanks to the extraordinary Girard-Perregaux movement, Calibre 59, which is based on the AS 5008 (later the La Joux-Perret 5900).

                            When Patek Philippe released the Aquanaut in 1997 it was considered part of the Gerald Genta-designed Nautilus collection and shared some of its famous design elements, including the rounded octagonal bezel that drew inspiration from a porthole. It was also the first Patek Philippe to come on a rubber strap. Having branched off from the Nautilus family and gone its own way, it’s now a popular watch within the brand’s catalogue and is perhaps its sportiest model, combining a dynamic and compact design with casual elegance. This model, with a khaki grenade-pattern dial featuring applied Arabic numerals in white gold, comes on a matching green rubber strap. The white gold case, a fraction over 42mm, houses the automatic Caliber 324 S C which holds a power reserve of up to 45 hours. The movement is visible through the case back, revealing the 21k gold rotor engraved with the brand’s Calatrava cross and decorated with côte de Genève stripes.

                            Named after the speedway track in Florida that hosts a legendary, Rolex-sponsored twenty-four hour race, the Daytona is the quintessential driver’s watch and was given a boost in popularity when Hollywood icon Paul Newman wore an early version of it. The dial, with its three subdials, is clear and easy to read while a tachymeter on the bezel offers quick speed calculations. It’s powered by Rolex’s Caliber 4130 automatic chronograph movement which holds a power reserve of 72 hours. Introduced in 1963 it’s been in continuous production ever since, although this particular reference is discontinued. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. With a black and gold colourway, this Daytona offers an understated bit of bling via its yellow gold case, as well as some additional sporty appeal thanks to its comfortable black rubber strap.

Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This incredible 40mm model in 18k Everose gold features a spellbinding sunburst dial that stands out beautifully within the black bezel. Presented on a black rubber Oysterflex bracelet, this is a spectacular timepiece that is currently one of the most sought-after watches around.

This version in white gold is notable for its black and red dial, which features Arabic numerals—unusual for a Daytona. It’s the perfect watch for anyone looking for an iconic Rolex model that is instantly recognisable yet noticeably different to most Daytona models in circulation.

                            The Royal Oak was an industry revelation on its release in 1972, becoming the first luxury steel sports watch—with a luxury price to match. Probably Gerald Genta’s most famous watch design, it stood in stark contrast to other watches owing to its octagonal bezel and robust integrated bracelet, one of the most distinctive ever designed. This stunning chronograph version in striking 18-carat yellow gold is now discontinued and features a silvered tapisserie dial, giving it  exquisite depth and texture, together with gold details including the hands and markers. The three sub-dials feature hours, minutes and small seconds, and there’s also a date aperture between 4 and 5 o’clock. It runs on an AP Caliber 2385 automatic movement which holds a power reserve of around 40 hours. A high-quality black alligator strap enhances the look of unbridled luxury with which this now-iconic watch is synonymous.

                            The ref 6263 is one of the most coveted models from the most desirable watch family of all time: the Rolex Daytona. Rolex manufactured the 6263 from 1971 to 1988 in relatively low numbers. It features an evolution of the iconic screw-down pushers, first seen in ref 6240, that gave the Cosmograph such strong water resistance, and which gives the 6263 its distinct Daytona 'look'. It runs on the workhorse Valjoux 72 movement, making the watch more than durable enough for everyday wear, despite its remarkable vintage.

                            The Rotonde De Cartier offers a stark contrast to the traditional, small rectangular cases with which this brand is synonymous. It features a 40mm circular case and beautiful tourbillon on the dial—a rare example of the famed French jeweller letting its hair down. The Rotonde collection consists primarily of watches with added complications, hence the flying tourbillon seen here. Made in a stunning rose gold, the reference W1556215 houses the hand-wound calibre 9452 MC, while boasting a celebrated Geneva Seal and 142 parts and 19 jewels and a frequency of 21600 vph—all visible through the open case back. This watch is an impressive piece that is sure to turn heads with its elegant and refined looks, while displaying the very best of Cartier’s watchmaking skills.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This glitzy Daytona features a white gold case with a diamond-studded bezel and a white mother-of-pearl dial that boasts even more diamonds via the hour markers. This is a unique Daytona perfect for those into bedazzling timepieces.

                            The unmistakeable Luminor case, launched in 1993, was later joined by the 1950 case, introduced in 2002— inspired by the Panerai model from 1950, hence the name. A limited-edition piece of just 100 watches released, this 1950 features the in-house P.2005/B calibre movement, which boasts Panerai’s patented cage technology. This movement contains the balance wheel and escapement which rotates on an axis perpendicular to the balance, not parallel with it. This cuts the usual amount of time for a complete revolution from sixty seconds to just thirty. This reference also boasts hours, minutes, small seconds, GMT, 24-hour indicator, six-day power reserve indicator visible through the case back and a tourbillon—all presented in a slick, black ceramic case.

                            Self-proclaimed specialists in the “art of fusion”, Hublot shook up the watch world back in 2015 with its new Big Bang Tourbillion 5-Day Power Reserve Indicator. The tourbillion complication is on full display thanks to the striking, skeletonised dial, which is encased in either titanium or 18k King Gold—depending on personal preference. A limited edition watch with only 99 pieces ever made, this is hugely sought after by Hublot aficionados. After the appointment of CEO Jean-Claude Biver in 2004, Hublot released their new Big Bang series, with the objective to modernise the brand with this new, flagship collection. Unveiled at Basel in 2005, the Big Bang certainly lived up to its name, gathering a mass of fans and great acclaim. The series takes inspiration from Hublot’s original 1980 launch model, featuring the now-familiar porthole-inspired round bezel, exposed screws and rubber strap—all of which are synonymous with Hublot today.

                            This exceptional and rarely seen Breguet tourbillon and 24-hour power reserve comes from Breguet's “Classique Complication” family of truly extraordinary complex timepieces, known for fusing the very best of aesthetic and technical beauty With these astonishing timepieces, mostly released in highly limited editions, the company demonstrates its continuing command of its founder Abraham-Louis Breguet's greatest talent: utter mechanical mastery. This particular watch features a gorgeous platinum case and an exquisite engine-turned dial, as well as several impressive complications including an integrated seconds hand tourbillon at 6 o'clock (symmetrically mirroring the main display above) and retrograde indicators for the power reserve and AM/PM to the left and right respectively. The overall effect is one of classical harmony and breathtaking horological proficiency.

                            From the brand founded by arguably the greatest watchmaker ever—Louis Breguet—the Breguet Tradition 7047BR/G9/9ZU was introduced at 2012’s Baselworld. The Tradition 7047BR Tourbillon Fusee and Chain is one of the watchmaker’s most interesting watches to date. This is in part down to the 7047BR movement and its unique configuration—it is exposed on the dial side of the watch instead of the usual case back side—plus, it is protected by a tall domed sapphire crystal, which adds to its aesthetic appeal. The Tradition 7047BR comes in a 41 mm 18kt white gold or rose gold case, which is fully polished with Breguet’s signature finely fluted caseband. The dial comes in black-coated, engine-turned 18kt gold and is off-centred at 7 o’clock, while a 60-second tourbillon sits at 1 o’clock. The hand-wound manufacture movement, calibre 569, is anthracite coated and features a tourbillon and a constant force fusee and chain transmission. This Breguet is perfect for lovers of unusual watches and the industrial aesthetic.

                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            This watch is not just a classic Submariner—one of the most popular and iconic watches in the world—but a striking and highly collectible variant edition. The watch is easily recognisable thanks to its rare green bezel and dial, causing collectors to give it the affectionate nickname “Hulk”, although LV itself stands for Lunette Vert (“Green Bezel”). This larger version updates the previous LV model ref 16610 (called “Kermit”) that was originally introduced in 2003 for the 50th anniversary of the Submariner. This edition boasts ceramic inserts in the bezel, with numerals in platinum.

                            Zenith won global acclaim in 1969 when it beats its rivals to launch the world’s first automatically wound wristwatch chronograph movement. It named the watch ‘El Primero’— meaning ‘the first’ — and it remains the brand’s most recognisable watch, with numerous versions available. This all-black ‘Spindrift’ model is named after a team that participates in catamaran sailboat racing and comes in a steel-coated, matt-black DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) case, making it extremely scratch-resistant. The carbon-fibre dial opens up at 10 o’clock to reveal the escapement and there are dual chronograph counters: the 30-minute counter at 3 o’clock and the 12-hour counter at 6 o’clock. ‘Spindrift Racing’ is inscribed on the internal bezel and the team’s logo features on the rotor, seen through the exhibition caseback. Inside you’ll find Zenith’s 4061 El Primero calibre, while the power reserve is 50 hours.

                            This superb, understated Radiomir features Panerai's special ceramic case material. It's called “composite” instead of ceramic to differentiate it from the ceramics of other watchmakers, which are typically made with a zirconium base. Panerai's is created by electrochemical processes using aluminium, making it harder and tougher than other ceramics, not to mention lighter than even titanium. Not only is the watch made with unique, cutting edge materials, but it also features a highly prestigious in-house movement. P.3000 has a power reserve of three days and a allows the hour to be set in discrete jumps without interfering with the workings of the seconds or minutes.

                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. Three limited edition pieces created at this time set the style for what would soon become Luminor. It somewhat modernised the 1940s-era look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the distinctive cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, with a a specialised GMT function and an impressive three-day power reserve, thanks to the stunning in-house movement P.9001.

                            The PAM 569 “Titanio” is a wonderful example of that rare beast in Panerai legend: the left-handed Luminor. Confusingly, Panerai calls these watches “destro”—Italian for “right”. That's because the watch is designed to be worn on the right hand, hence placing the crown on the left. However, this extraordinary limited edition is even more standout than other destro pieces like the 026. Hailing from the brand's impressive Submersible series, this is a rugged, practical titanium diving watch with a handsome, muscular aesthetic. The positioning of the date window at 9 o'clock accentuates the originality of the destro design, which is further perfected with the faux-patina luminova and hobnail dial, not to mention the superb in-house calibre P.9000.

                            Sleek, menacing and black as night, the PAM 441's dark allure is not the result of any external PVD or DLC. It's a fully ceramic case, much harder than steel and amazingly durable, the result of an exceptionally long and arduous process of diamond-wheel machining and microglass blasting to achieve the gorgeous matt finish. The material is too hard to mould and is originally created by extreme isostatic pressing of zirconium oxide followed by sintering at around 1,500°C. The beautiful in-house P.9000 movement has an impressive power reserve of three days and also features a GMT complication.

                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 46mm sports watch with a silver, black and yellow colour scheme inspired by the brand's work in the Galapagos Islands.

                            TAG Heuer's Calibre 12 LS automatic chronograph is remarkable for many reasons. The most immediately striking is the gorgeous racing watch design based on the iconic shape of the Monaco, one of the best loved drivers' watches in the world. But the Calibre 12 is not just a pretty red, white and black face. It has also developed an innovative and stunning new way of showing the time: the LS “linear system”, which gives many of the subdials a resemblance to classic dashboard indicators. At the top is the date window, where a whole section of the wheel is purposely visible. Then there's the unique retrograde seconds at 3 o'clock, which uses different coloured “hands” to show half a minute in a line, one after another. Finally the two chronograph counters: hours at 6 o'clock is comparatively conventional, while the 30 minute counter at 9 o'clock is a speedometer; like the seconds, two hands count 15 minutes each. The effect is breathtaking.

                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. These watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, staying remarkably true to its historic legacy.

                            Hublot burst onto the Swiss watchmaking scene in 1980 with the most groundbreaking new design that the industry had seen in years. The idea was simple: a luxury gold watch made in the bold “porthole” style, but fitted with a rubber bracelet. The idea of “Fusion” was born—and innovative combinations of materials have remained a key part of the Hublot brand ever since. This extra special piece harks back to Fusion with a glorious skeletonised design that allows for a spectacular view of the ultra-thin movement and its 90-hour power reserve. As ever, the materials are remarkable: there's a stunning titanium case, bezel and screws, a ruthenium anthracite mainplate and bridges, all paired with a fine leather strap.

                            Tudor has stepped out of the shadow of its older sister brand Rolex in recent years, offering watches that feature some of the hallmarks of its more illustrious sibling but at a more accessible price point. It forged its distinct personality largely by delving into its archives and reviving old models, including the Pelagos, a version of a Tudor Submariner from the 1970s. This model is powered by an MT5612 in-house calibre, which replaced the ETA movement of previous Pelagos models. It bears the now-iconic Tudor ‘snowflake’ hands, echoed in the square indexes, and the date is displayed in the window at 3 o’clock. The 42mm case is a blend of steel and titanium, while the bezel—also titanium—is coated in matt black ceramic. A handsome and versatile divers’ watch, it is water resistant to 500 metres, boasts a helium escape valve at 9 o’clock and holds a 70-hour power reserve.

                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. These watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, staying remarkably true to its historic legacy.

Three limited edition pieces created at this time set the style for what would soon become Luminor.

Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, with a a specialised GMT function and an impressive three-day power reserve, thanks to the stunning in-house movement P.9001.

                            The Royal Oak Offshore raised eyebrows on its release in 1993 due to its hefty case size of 42mm. So much so it was quickly nicknamed ‘The Beast’. This 2010 release of the iconic Royal Oak Offshore is no exception, featuring a rugged, rose gold octagonal carbon fibre bezel. Audemars Piguet experimented with materials, opting for ones that are known for their high durability, relative lightness, and scratch-resistance: namely, forged carbon fibre and ceramic and a mix of carbon fibre on the case and lugs with a natural alligator leather strap—something more synonymous with fellow Swiss watchmaker Hublot. Boasting a tourbillion chronograph complication, visible through the skeletonised dial, this Royal Oak Offshore makes for an interesting piece within Audemars’ catalogue.

                            Long known as the “Moonwatch”, Omega's Speedmaster became an instant legend in the 1960s when it was chosen by NASA for official use in space, including the Gemini and Apollo programmes. But it was not originally designed for such a use. So in 1969, Omega produced a new, even more qualified watch—the Speedmaster MkII—for space missions. With a distinctive, tapered case, it came with either a regular black dial or the rarer “racing” dial. Unfortunately, the MkII was rejected by the astronauts for superstitious reasons and seemed destined to fade into the shadows of history until, happily, Omega re-released a modern version more recently. This watch, however, is the original model in all its vintage glory.

Adorned in a black rubber coating, the stealthy watch is right at home on the black, volcanic Galapagos rock to which creatures have had to adapt in order to survive. A proportion of the proceeds from the sales of Galapagos edition watches have been donated to help maintain the environment of the islands.

                            The Cartier Tank has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design—inspired by the shape of a tank—that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            This Panerai Radiomir is 1 of 1000 made and features a ‘tropical’ dial. 
The watch’s dial has been fashioned to resemble the patina seen on vintage Panerai watches which have suffered the effects of radioactive exposure. The Radiomir paint in the vintage watches emitted gamma rays, from the radioactive Radium, and aged the watch in a fashion which turned the originally black paint to a light brown colour. 
Brevetatto, the Italian for patented, is inscribed around the bezel and refers to the design of the watch which adheres to a vintage aesthetic, Panerai have used a 12-sided bezel like those found on prototype watches from the 1930’s.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. A variant on the regular 116710, this reference features gold elements in the bezel, crown, hands, indices and of course the bracelet.

                            When Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the lunar module, codenamed ‘Eagle’, and onto the powdery surface of the moon, the Omega Speedmaster on his wrist became the legendary Moonwatch. Tested to the limits by NASA for the rigours of space flight, the Speedmaster had in fact been into space before the testing had even begun. In October 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra took his own personal Speedmaster on board Sigma 7 and orbited Earth a total of six times for the Mercury 7 mission. The Speedmaster continued to provide NASA astronauts with invaluable service for the Apollo 13 mission, when it was used to time the crucial burn that would return the astronauts safely to Earth.

                            Named after Lake Geneva, the Blancpain Léman collection seeks to capture the evocative natural beauty of this iconic landmark, as well as its proximity to the heart of Swiss watchmaking heritage. With a strong grasp of traditional designs, the Léman watches are classic and authoritative, while simultaneously contemporary and refreshing. This stunning model, known as the Réveil GMT, is notable for its superb mechanical calibre (visible through the caseback), featuring a range of prestigious complications. These include a second timezone and power reserve display, and perhaps most impressive of all, a mechanical alarm.

                            Though they were not a mainstay of the company's catalogue until the 1990s, IWC's Portuguese watches originated as consummate maritime chronometers in the early part of the 20th century, and have established a long and outstanding history of both mechanical and design elegance. Now, the Portuguese has been united with IWC's superb 50000 series of movements (this version houses the 50900), with many exceptional features: a seven-day power reserve that ingeniously stops itself when torque runs low, an escape wheel identical to that of the iconic calibre 89, the brand's hallmark Pellaton pawl-winding system and best of all, a glorious Tourbillon Mystere at 12 o'clock.

                            This watch is not just a classic Submariner—one of the most popular and iconic watches in the world—but a striking and highly collectible variant edition. The watch is easily recognisable thanks to its rare green bezel and dial, causing collectors to give it the affectionate nickname “Hulk”, although LV itself stands for Lunette Vert (“Green Bezel”). This larger version updates the previous LV model ref 16610 (called “Kermit”) that was originally introduced in 2003 for the 50th anniversary of the Submariner. This edition boasts ceramic inserts in the bezel, with numerals in platinum.

                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. These watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, staying remarkably true to its historic legacy.

                            Named after the quaint Alpine village where the company's workshops are located, the Villeret collection undoubtedly comprises Blancpain's most classic and elegant watches. Like the town of Villeret itself, the watches are rooted in the oldest and most admirable qualities of Swiss watchmaking. The aesthetic is understated but confident in its exquisite design and finishing of premium quality materials. All of Blancpain's 300 years of experience at the very highest levels of haute horlogerie is brought to bear in this beautiful series. This particularly excellent model features a complete set of calendar and moonphase complications, marking it as a superb example of high-end mechanical accomplishment.

                            The Seamaster is one of the most iconic diving watches of all time. By the 1950s, it was among the most dependable and professionally sought dive watches from any brand, and it soon pioneered some of the sporty must-have features we associate with such watches, including unidirectional bezels, phosphorescent hands and the helium escape valve. The year 2005 saw the launch of a modern classic: the Seamaster Planet Ocean. This collection bursts with innovative style and energy, its design clearly rooted in Seamaster heritage yet daring to be original at the same time. The Planet Ocean's popularity only soared after being spotted on the wrist of Daniel Craig's James Bond in Casino Royale and its sequels.

                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 46mm sports watch with a silver, black and yellow colour scheme inspired by the brand's work in the Galapagos Islands.

                            Originating in Florence, Tuscany, Panerai has a long history of making stylish and extremely reliable watches for professional divers, beginning with its famed WWII contract for the Italian Navy's “Frogmen”. The PAM Submersible pieces are among Panerai's finest diving tools. This superb example features a super-tough black carbon fibre (‘Carbotech’) case and bezel with graduated scale. The watch runs on the in-house P.9000 movement, which boasts a 3-day power reserve from two barrels and allows the wearer to change the time in convenient 1-hour increments. The matching black factory strap is made of a durable rubber that is perfect for diving.

                            While this watch shares many of the beloved characteristics associated with the Panerai Radiomir—big cushion case; vintage, legible design; sandwich dial; onion crown; leather strap—it is strikingly different in its immediate impact on the viewer. Sleek, menacing and black as night, the PAM 292's dark allure is not the result of any external PVD or DLC. It's a fully ceramic case, much harder than steel and amazingly durable, the result of an exceptionally long and arduous process of diamond-wheel machining and microglass blasting. The material is too hard to mould and is originally created by extreme isostatic pressing of zirconium oxide followed by sintering at around 1,500°C.

                            The Radiomir collection is named after the distinctive luminescent compound Panerai developed when it sold watches to the Italian Navy in the 1930s. Today it is known for several beloved characteristics that have made it an icon of horology—big cushion case; vintage, legible design; sandwich dial; onion crown; and leather strap. Here we have a gorgeous 47mm limited edition in polished pink gold that positively gleams on the wrist. Known as the Ora Rosa, this version features a superb, paired-down dial. The transparent caseback allows the owner to examine the stunning in-house movement P.3000, which boasts two barrels and three days of power.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilots' watches. Created by the legendary designer Gerald Genta in the 1970s, the watch was allegedly inspired by a diving helmet, giving Genta the relatively new idea of leaving the functional case elements like screws and bores exposed, instead of hiding them away. The modernist aesthetic was a huge success for IWC, and the Ingenieur has become a horological icon. This fantastic example features the brand's other speciality, the perpetual calendar, with a perfect Ingenieur-faithful design interpretation.

                            If you're a big fan of Panerai, the legendary Italian watchmaker, chances are you've encountered Paneristi.com, the “unofficial resource” and forum where collectors and enthusiasts meet and discuss everything Panerai-related. In a spectacular gesture of good will towards its loyal supporters, the brand itself agreed to create a very limited run of watches in collaboration with the Paneristi site moderators themselves. PVD case, painted patina dial, OP logo, and even a special caseback inscription that commemorates the forum's 10th anniversary—this is the ultimate Panerai for collectors. Competition to own one couldn't have been more fierce.

                            Given the Big Bang's origins, with its porthole-inspired design, there have been nautical themes in the collection from the start—if faint ones. So when it came time for Hublot to create its first “serious” diving watch, it made some sense to turn to the King Power, the even bigger, bolder version of the already spectacular Big Bang series. Hublot was never going to do things by halves. Made of lightweight carbon fibre, this “Oceanographic” has a beastly 48mm case distinguished by the monstrous crown at 2 o'clock (its smaller brother at 4 o'clock is for the inner bezel), and a super-legible dial. The crystal is a massive 6.5mm thick, providing the immense water resistance that would keep this extraordinary watch safe and sound on the ocean floor.

                            The Luminor 127 is a unique and very special watch in the Panerai pantheon, one close to the hearts of many collectors and affectionately nicknamed the “Fiddy”. First released in 2002, it is an uncanny recreation of a gorgeous vintage timepiece from 1950 (hence the limited edition number), and is known for many important features. For a start, it is 47mm in diameter, a large size with which the brand would subsequently become associated (some claim that Panerai were the ones who launched the whole oversize trend). Then there's the unique form of sandwich dial, rarely seen before, which combined with the crown guard and domed sapphire crystal to create an extremely cool aura of vintage Italian style—one that few others have achieved.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they're among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79350, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            Binding classical watchmaking tradition with modern creativity, the Audemars Piguet Millenary is as playful and unique as it is mesmerising to behold. The collection builds its neo-classical aesthetic by taking inspiration from the best of traditional watchmaking and reimagining it for the third millennium. The Millenary is known for its superb oval case that provides room to play with circular, off-centre sub-dials that overlap in pleasing arrangements. This is the perfect watch for those who want to showcase their avant-guard taste while remaining true to the peerless Audemars Piguet heritage.

                            Originating in Florence, Tuscany, Panerai has a long history of making stylish and extremely reliable watches for professional divers, beginning with its famed WWII contract for the Italian Navy's “Frogmen”. The PAM Submersible pieces are among Panerai's finest diving tools. This superb example features a super-tough black carbon fibre (‘Carbotech’) case and bezel with graduated scale. The watch runs on the in-house P.9000 movement, which boasts a 3-day power reserve from two barrels and allows the wearer to change the time in convenient 1-hour increments. The matching black factory strap is made of a durable rubber that is perfect for diving.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilots' watches. Created by the legendary designer Gerald Genta in the 1970s, the watch was allegedly inspired by a diving helmet, giving Genta the relatively new idea of leaving the functional case elements like screws and bores exposed, instead of hiding them away. The modernist aesthetic was a huge success for IWC, and the Ingenieur has become a horological icon. This fantastic example features the brand's other speciality, the perpetual calendar, with a perfect Ingenieur-faithful design interpretation.

                            This extraordinary Hublot limited edition was made in honour of the Yacht Club de Monaco, and in particular of its flagship beauty, the Tuiga. Built in the legendary William Fife boatyard, Scotland, Tuiga has enjoyed more than a century of prestigious sailing. It was purchased for the Club in 1995 by HSH Prince Albert II, and continues to valiantly represent its values and maritime heritage at major regattas. Originally inspired by the portholes on similar vessels, the Big Bang has a maritime history of its own, making it the perfect choice to commemorate the Tuiga in this very special edition, with a tantalum case and ceramic bezel. An image of the vessel is depicted on the exhibition caseback.

                            This superb, understated Radiomir features Panerai's special ceramic case material. It's called “composite” instead of ceramic to differentiate it from the ceramics of other watchmakers, which are typically made with a zirconium base. Panerai's is created by electrochemical processes using aluminium, making it harder and tougher than other ceramics, not to mention lighter than even titanium. Not only is the watch made with unique, cutting edge materials, but it also features a highly prestigious in-house movement. P.3000 has a power reserve of three days and a allows the hour to be set in discrete jumps without interfering with the workings of the seconds or minutes.

                            The Luminor 127 is a unique and very special watch in the Panerai pantheon, one close to the hearts of many collectors and affectionately nicknamed the “Fiddy”. First released in 2002, it is an uncanny recreation of a gorgeous vintage timepiece from 1950 (hence the limited edition number), and is known for many important features. For a start, it is 47mm in diameter, a large size with which the brand would subsequently become associated (some claim that Panerai were the ones who launched the whole oversize trend). Then there's the unique form of sandwich dial, rarely seen before, which combined with the crown guard and domed sapphire crystal to create an extremely cool aura of vintage Italian style—one that few others have achieved.

                            The Radiomir collection is named after the distinctive luminescent compound Panerai developed when it sold watches to the Italian Navy in the 1930s. Today it is known for several beloved characteristics that have made it an icon of horology—big cushion case; vintage, legible design; sandwich dial; onion crown; and leather strap. Here we have a gorgeous 47mm limited edition in polished pink gold that positively gleams on the wrist. Known as the Ora Rosa, this version features a superb, paired-down dial. The transparent caseback allows the owner to examine the stunning in-house movement P.3000, which boasts two barrels and three days of power.

                            This special Luminor pays tribute to some of the brand's vintage early 20th century models, when Panerai was making “Marina Militare” watches for the Italian and Egyptian Navies. One rare timepiece built for the latter, the GPF 2/56, became legendary for its huge 66mm size and “Angelus” movement with an eight day power reserve. It had the words “8 giorni brevettato” (“8 days patented”) written around a circle on the dial, a mark which has since become something of a Panerai holy symbol. Only a tiny number of modern references also have this marking, of which this wonderful PAM 590 is one. The modern, in-house P.5000 movement also has an impressive power reserve of eight days, while the caseback has an engraving of a Frogman with his SLC human torpedo (another iconic chapter of Panerai history).

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 448 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, authentic black dial and the blue hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they're among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79350, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 448 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, authentic black dial and the blue hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            Originating in Florence, Tuscany, Panerai has a long history of making stylish and extremely reliable watches for professional divers, beginning with its famed WWII contract for the Italian Navy's “Frogmen”. The PAM Submersible pieces are among Panerai's finest diving tools. This superb example features a super-tough black carbon fibre (‘Carbotech’) case and bezel with graduated scale. The watch runs on the in-house P.9000 movement, which boasts a 3-day power reserve from two barrels and allows the wearer to change the time in convenient 1-hour increments. The matching black factory strap is made of a durable rubber that is perfect for diving.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they're among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79350, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            Given the Big Bang's origins, with its porthole-inspired design, there have been nautical themes in the collection from the start—if faint ones. So when it came time for Hublot to create its first “serious” diving watch, it made some sense to turn to the King Power, the even bigger, bolder version of the already spectacular Big Bang series. Hublot was never going to do things by halves. Made of lightweight carbon fibre, this “Oceanographic” has a beastly 48mm case distinguished by the monstrous crown at 2 o'clock (its smaller brother at 4 o'clock is for the inner bezel), and a super-legible dial. The crystal is a massive 6.5mm thick, providing the immense water resistance that would keep this extraordinary watch safe and sound on the ocean floor.

                            Designed by Emmanuelle Gueit to celebrate twenty years since the 1972 release of its now-iconic older brother, the Royal Oak, the Offshore range of watches is said to have influenced the trend for oversized watches that began in the mid 1990s. Similar to its forebear, which was designed by Gerald Genta, the Royal Oak Offshore is bigger and bolder, often paired with tough rubber straps. This particular model features an unusual chocolate brown tapisserie dial paired with blue sub-dials—a truly stunning combination that is complemented by the brown alligator strap. Although the 42mm case is steel, white gold was used for the hour and minutes hands, as well as the rims of the Arabic luminescent numerals. This watch runs on an AP caliber 3126/3840 automatic movement which holds a power reserve of approximately 50 hours.

                            This masterful Luminor 1950 from Panerai features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph (also known as a rattrapante), one of high-end watchmaking's most challenging mechanical complications to manufacture. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden; an extra pusher at 8 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other hand continues to run. The PAM 213 uses the OP XVIII movement, based on a stunning and unusual column wheel Valjoux 7750.

                            The modern Luminor design originated in the early 1950s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. Three limited edition pieces created at this time set the style for what would soon become Luminor. It somewhat updated the look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, and continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950’s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its black carbide titanium case, red highlights and ceramic bezel. The watch uses TAG's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features a modern version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

                            IWC's Top Gun series stands as a tribute to the elite pilot's training centre for the US Marines in Miramar, California, immortalised by the iconic 1986 Tom Cruise motion picture. The design is built to recall the deck watches of the 1930s and 1940s, referencing IWC's history in pilot's watches.  This impressive watch also features an elaborate Top Gun engraving, stunning anthracite dial and an extra lightweight ceramic and titanium case made with zirconium oxide fired at temperatures approaching 2,000 degrees centigrade. The in-house calibre 51111 has a seven day power reserve, and the watch comes with a military style green textile strap.

                            The Grand Lange 1 is, as the name suggests, a larger version of the Lange 1, which was one of the four new watches the German brand presented when it was revived in 1994 after decades of dormancy. The company has gone on to be the flagbearer for fine, traditional watchmaking in the east German town of Glashütte. At 41mm it is significantly larger than the 37mm Lange 1 and features a moonphase display within the main sub-dial, while elsewhere can be found a big date display, power reserve indicator and small seconds, all harmoniously positioned within the asymmetrical silver dial. Like the Lange 1, it’s powered by a manual-wind movement seen through display caseback, revealing Glashutte stripes and intricate engraving. The date for months that don’t run to 31 days is corrected via a button on the side of the yellow-gold case and the power reserve is three days.

                            The Grand Prix de Monaco is one of the most iconic events in all of motor racing. Held since 1929, the race takes place on the streets of the city—challenging for drivers and exhilarating for spectators. Just as the event was updated in the late 90s to become the “Grand Prix de Monaco Historique”, so have Chopard's exceptional racing watches that commemorate it. The Monaco Historique collection, launched in 2014, marks a turning point for the Grand Prix watches. They are no longer simply a bunch of coveted and collectible Limited Editions, but now have a magnificently good-looking permanent backbone on which to build. This beauty in steel showcases all of the Monaco Historique's best qualities.

                            On the surface, the PAM 141 seems like a relatively typical example of Panerai's iconic Radiomir series, with its big cushion cases, glorious onion crown and leather strap – the same look that has been doing wonders for the brand ever since it started out making watches for the Italian Navy back in the 1930s. But flip this watch over and the stunning view through the sapphire crystal caseback will reveal something you won't see in many other Radiomirs: the 141 is powered by the OP VII, based on the famous Elite movement by fellow Swiss horological giant, Zenith. In fact, it's none other than the Elite 680, a prestigious ultra-thin calibre beating at 28,000 vph. Because of this, the PAM 141 is highly sought-after, particularly as it's thought that only 500 were ever made.

                            Rolex has long been popular among women who know their horology. Unlike some brands that relegate ladies' watches to mere fashion statements, Rolex gives just as much care and attention to their mechanical credentials as it does for watches aimed at men. The Lady Datejust participates in the same legendary horological history of Rolex's groundbreaking introduction of the date window in 1945, and still bears the famous 'Superlative Chronometer Officially Certified' on the dial. Its slimmed-down size allows for stunning elegance and attention to detail, and this model is equipped with the superb calibre 2235 self-winding movement.

                            Named after the speedway track in Florida that hosts a legendary, Rolex-sponsored twenty-four hour race, the Daytona is the quintessential driver’s watch and was given a boost in popularity when Hollywood icon Paul Newman wore an early version of it. The dial, with its three subdials, is clear and easy to read while a tachymeter on the bezel offers quick speed calculations. It’s powered by Rolex’s Caliber 4130 automatic chronograph movement which holds a power reserve of 72 hours. Introduced in 1963 it’s been in continuous production ever since, although this particular reference is discontinued. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit.

                            In 2008, Rolex released the Day-Date II, a modern update of the timelessly classic Day-Date, which features a larger case (41mm) than the original. This in turn was replaced in 2015 by the Day-Date 40 which, as the name implies, comes in a 40mm case. This version in white gold features the signature fluted bezel, within which is a silver dial bearing baguette diamond indices. The date at 3 o’clock lies beneath the signature Rolex Cyclops magnifying lens for better legibility. It comes on a President bracelet and runs on the Caliber 3255 automatic movement. Famously, the Day-Date was the first watch to indicate the day of the week spelt out in full when it was launched in 1956, and it has gone on to be worn by everyone from the Dalai Lama to numerous US presidents, hence it’s ‘President’ nickname.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with high quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage while daring to forge its own path, boasting an energetic modern design with classic racing-red highlights.

                            Nicolas Rieussec was the first collection launched by Montblanc after the company took control of the prestigious Minerva manufacture in Villeret. The watches are named after the French inventor of the chronograph, which was originally a device that measured intervals by moving a pen in contact with rotating paper, drawing an arc as it went (hence the name chronograph, from the Greek for “time-writing”). The Nicolas Rieussec watches were also the first to house an in-house Montblanc movement, propelling the brand into the upper echelons of haute horlogerie. Matching tradition with innovation, this stunning watch is a monopusher column-wheel chrono, with a second timezone on the main dial paired with a day/night indicator that mirrors the date window.

                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. At 42mm, this is the smallest Aquatimer in the collection, and its black, silver and green colours are inspired by the Galapagos Islands.

                            The Rolex Explorer is one of the most highly valued and sought out models for buyers with a lot of experience in the often complicated world of vintage watch collecting. Originally based on the model worn by Tenzing Norgay in the first ever successful ascent of Everest in 1953, the Explorer was a versatile timepiece that enjoyed numerous variations. This reference 14270 is an excellent example. Starting in 1989, it brought a well-received modern upgrade to the Explorer family, while staying faithful to the original model—and also introduced the superb calibre 3000.

                            The U-2 is one of the most important high-tech spy planes in the US Airforce. Nicknamed the Dragon Lady, early versions of the U-2 were in operation at the beginning of the Cold War, and continue to be flown by exceptional pilots based in Beale, California. Needless to say, this is the type of aviation history that Bremont adores. The U-2 collection is a sincerely heartfelt tribute to these amazing machines and the brave souls who fly them, often over 80,000 feet into the stratosphere for 12 hours or more at a time. The beautifully designed U-2 watches have, like the plane, been tested at even higher altitudes, as well as at temperature extremes of -40ºC or more—including tests “in the field” with the U-2 pilots themselves. The watch's ultra-durable Trip-Tick case contains an inner bezel operated by a crown at 4 o'clock.

                            Panerai has several watches with amazingly long power reserves, yet even by its standards the Radiomir 10 days is stands out from the crowd. The watch harnesses three large mainspring barrels to generate this much power, and the superb mechanical specs of the in-house P.2003 movement ensure that this energy is distributed cleanly and evenly without any compromise of timekeeping precision. In addition to the power reserve, which is displayed on a subdial at 6 o'clock, the watch also boasts a GMT complication, using an extra hand from the centre (instantly recognisable thanks to its striking arrow head). This is accompanied by a day/night indicator inside the small seconds dial.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, continuing Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense 'Carrera Panamerica', road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera has long been sought to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams. This addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its large 60-second chronograph counter, as well as racing-themed colouring and tachymeter scale on the bezel. The watch also benefits from an anti-reflective coating on the scratch-resistant sapphire crystal.

                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 44mm sports watch with a striking colour scheme.

                            Bremont describes the Supermarine collection as “divers watches inspired by our aviation principles”. This doesn't mean the Supermarine is a pilot's watch, but rather a traditional, good-looking and high-grade diver that is—at heart—a Bremont. Demonstrating the brand's no-nonsense British clarity and effortless sense of refinement, the Supermarine also boasts the impressive technical credentials for which Bremont, a relatively small independent brand, is rightly acclaimed. The watch uses Bremont's anti-shock mount, a Faraday cage and a helium escape valve to make itself seriously durable. Meanwhile, accuracy is guaranteed by the Swiss chronometer inside, lovingly embellished and assembled in Bremont's Henley factory.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. A variant on the regular 116710, this reference features gold elements in the bezel, crown, hands, indices and of course the bracelet.

                            The modern Luminor design originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military-only contractor. Three limited edition pieces created at this time set the style for what would soon become modern Luminor. It somewhat modernised the 1940s-era look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the distinctive cushion case, and a crown guard to boost water resistance. This lovely example has an in-house movement, the P.3002, with a power reserve of three days that is displayed in a sophisticated retrograde indicator on the dial.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            Luxury watchmaking in England was given a welcome boost with the launch of Bremont in 2002. Founded by brothers Giles and Nick English, it began by making beautifully crafted pilots’ watches, most of which are ISO chronometer rated, and has brought out a number of intriguing limited editions that incorporate history into the actual watch in the most literal sense. This model features an actual piece of fabric used on the 1903 Wright Flyer aircraft that marked the beginning of the pioneer era of aviation. It can be seen through the transparent caseback, as can the automatic movement, which is powered by a rotor that bears the words ‘Wright Flyer’, the initials of the Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville, and a delightful propellor design. This hugely collectible watch, with a 50-hour power reserve, is one of just 300 pieces.

                            It may be known for its iconic aviation watches that have led the industry for decades, but Breitling is more than adept when it comes to good-looking, functional horological tools of other kinds. Many Breitling diving watches are masterful pieces of engineering; the Superocean is surely the greatest example. The first Superocean was unveiled in the 1950s, made for professional and military use. More recently, the Superocean Heritage collection pays tribute to these superb timepieces with a design based on the original, though the technical specs have of course been upgraded to the highest modern standards. This clean and elegant model boasts 200m water resistance and a superb Swiss calibre.

                            While it's the limited, historical or complicated pieces that often get most of the attention when it comes to Panerai, many collectors are more interested in the more straightforward “Base” models, where they feel that the real essence of the brand can be found. These entry level watches come without distracting bells and whistles, at a comparatively affordable price point, yet they still have all of Panerai's best attributes in spades. Case in point is this lovely PAM560, one of five new Base models in 2014. It's very similar to its predecessor, the PAM112, with one major difference: inside beats the company's amazing in-house movement, Calibre P.5000, complete with double barrelled 8-day power reserve.

                            Fascinating, innovative and technically unique, Jaeger-LeCoultre's Duometre watches are often overlooked despite being one of the most impressive collections in the brand's stable (no small achievement). The watches use a brilliant “dual wing” movement boasting two separate mainspring power sources. The first is used purely for the main time display, and the other caters to additional complications. In this case, the elegant dial showcases the hours and minutes symmetrically opposite a dial combining the date with a sophisticated dual-hemisphere moonphase display. There is a long seconds hand from the centre, while the 6 o'clock subdial features jumping sixths of a second. It's flanked by exquisite exhibition apertures into the movement's workings—including power reserve indicators for each of the “dual wing” sources.

                            Since 1946, British aerospace company Martin-Baker has saved the lives of at least 7,450 pilots. That's because it makes ejection seats—one of the most vital pieces of safety equipment on any high-speed aircraft. Martin-Baker seats are the best of the best, tested to the most punishing levels of endurance and extremes of shock, vibration, temperature and more. Amazingly, Bremont's Martin-Baker watches have been put through the same rigours used on the ejection seats, at the same test facility. Fitted with anti-shock movement mounts and Faraday cages, the MB watches are made to be the ultimate endurance chronometer, able to survive just about anything short of a direct meteor strike. They're also not half handsome to look at.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, continuing Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense 'Carrera Panamerica' road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera has long been sought to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams. This addition to the Carrera collection fully embodies that racing heritage with its large 60-second chronograph counter, as well as racing-themed colouring and tachymeter scale on the bezel.

                            The Cartier Tank has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design—inspired by the shape of a tank—that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            The Seamaster is one of the most iconic diving watches of all time. By the 1950s, it was among the most dependable and professionally sought dive watches from any brand, and it soon pioneered some of the sporty must-have features we associate with such watches, including unidirectional bezels, phosphorescent hands and the helium escape valve. The year 2005 saw the launch of a modern classic: the Seamaster Planet Ocean. This collection bursts with innovative style and energy, its design clearly rooted in Seamaster heritage yet daring to be original at the same time. The Planet Ocean's popularity only soared after being spotted on the wrist of Daniel Craig's James Bond in Casino Royale and its sequels.

                            From the world’s most revered historical watchmaker comes this exquisite and highly refined Grand Complications model, comprising a split-seconds chronograph, perpetual calendar and moonphase. Patek Philippe’s heritage in producing Grand Complications watches is unrivalled, with the brand famously making pocket watches for the renowned watch-collecting banker, Henry Graves, in the early 20th century. These days it puts its most intricate complications in its wristwatches, like this fine example in 18k rose gold. This being a perpetual calendar—with no need to adjust the watch for shorter months or leap years, at least until the year 2100—there is also a leap-year indicator, together with a day-night indicator. This extraordinary timepiece runs on Patek Philippe’s manually wound Caliber CHR 29 535 PS Q, visible through the sapphire caseback, enabling you to appreciate the movement’s spell-binding hand-finishing.

                            This is Omega’s first ever world timer model and one of just 87 pieces made, making it one of the brand’s most unusual and rare watches. Most notably, the dial's centre features a colourful hand-crafted enamel world map as viewed from the North Pole, which is surrounded by a 24-hour reference ring giving the time in a number of cities, from Athens to Auckland. The dart 12-hour indices and hands are 18k yellow gold and coated in Super-LumiNova and the 43mm case, unusually for an Omega, is platinum. There is also a discreet date window at 6 o’clock. It comes on a brown leather strap with a platinum-gold foldover clasp, while inside is Omega’s superbly finished Master Chronometer calibre 8939, a self-winding movement with co-axial escapement, which can be viewed through the exhibition caseback.

                            Describing its aesthetic as elegant, simple and creative, Vacheron Constantin has continually aimed to enhance and reinvent the art of fine watchmaking since its introduction over 265 years ago. The oldest Swiss watchmaker in continuous operation, it has cemented its place within the top three watchmakers in the world. This Patrimony Traditionnelle features a fourteen-day tourbillon, with a power reserve of about 336 hours—that’s two weeks—as well as Vacheron Constantin’s beautiful and prestigious in-house movement, the calibre 2260. As with all models from this watchmaker, it bears the Seal of Geneva—a sign of superior quality, craftmanship and reliability. The piece is also said to be perhaps the longest power reserve tourbillon-based watch with a single mainspring barrel—an impressive feat. The Patrimony Traditionnelle showcases Vacheron Constantin at its best, with a dial that combines modest features and an opening to a strikingly complex mechanism.

                            Named after Lake Geneva, the Blancpain Léman collection seeks to capture the evocative natural beauty of this iconic landmark, as well as its proximity to the heart of Swiss watchmaking heritage. With a strong grasp of traditional designs, the Léman watches are classic and authoritative, while simultaneously contemporary and refreshing. They speak to the timeless watchmaking legacy of the Blancpain company, which has been creating horological masterpieces since 1735. This stunning model is notable for its superb mechanical calibre (visible through the caseback), featuring a second timezone complication complete with a particularly wonderful day/night indicator.

                            First released in 1932, back when pocket watches were still popular and the preferred option over wristwatches, the Calatrava is one of Patek Philippe’s most loved watches. A huge influence on watch designs since its release, this Calatrava boasts ornamentation work that took over 30-hours of meticulous artistry from expert craftsmen—and that’s just on the dial. Today, the Calatrava has a healthy number of references to choose from and takes the wearer from day to night, and this limited edition 5088 model from 2015 is certainly a showstopper. It features a beautiful hand-engraved black enamel dial, created using the burin—or engraver—a tiny tool that acts as an extension of the craftsman’s hand and penetrates the material to create the desired pattern. The exquisite enamelling even extends to the sides of the white gold case. Inside the watch is an ultra-thin self-winding mechanical movement with the calibre 240, also visible through the case back. Limited to just 10 pieces worldwide, this Calatrava is the ultimate collector’s piece.

                            The Da Vinci collection has been around for over 30 years now and this Da Vinci Perpetual Calendar Chronograph in 18-karat 5N gold showcases the very best of the range. With the moon sitting still against the dark blue night sky, the moon-phase indicator disc beneath the dial acts as the Earth’s shadow and lies within the totaliser sub-dial which includes the hour and minute counters, both merged at 12 o’clock. Plus, the handy flyback function allows ongoing chronograph measurements to be instantly “deleted” and a new measurement started without an intermediate stop, whereas the perpetual calendar’s sharp precision is made possible by the in-house 89630 calibre. This timepiece is perfect for any avid fans of IWC’s Da Vinci collection and watches that are as functional as they are beautiful.

                            This rare and incredibly elegant perpetual calendar is a true technical marvel. It's not just the quantity of data it records, from the date (including a four-digit year display) to the moonphase (with separate indications for northern and southern hemispheres) and even the seriously impressive seven-day power reserve (indicated inside the 3 o'clock subdial). The most extraordinary part of the watch is in fact the humble—yet sophisticated—crown. Based on the original design by the legendary watchmaker Kurt Klaus, the entire watch is set by the single crown; all components are connected so that you don't have to redo each little display one by one.

                            Panerai has several watches with amazingly long power reserves, yet even by its standards this 10-day Luminor stands out from the crowd. The watch harnesses three large mainspring barrels to generate this much power, and the superb mechanical specs of the in-house P.2003 movement ensure that this energy is distributed cleanly and evenly without any compromise of timekeeping precision. In addition to the power reserve, which has a “linear” display at 6 o'clock, the watch also boasts a GMT complication, using an extra hand from the centre (instantly recognisable thanks to its striking arrowhead). This is accompanied by a day/night indicator inside the small seconds dial.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, continuing Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense 'Carrera Panamerica', road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera has long been sought to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams. This addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its large 60-second chronograph counter, as well as racing-themed colouring and tachymeter scale on the bezel. The watch also benefits from an anti-reflective coating on the scratch-resistant sapphire crystal.

                            The Bell & Ross BR01 represents the cornerstone of the brand's DNA. The series was launched in 2005, marking Bell & Ross's first significant watch family since it ended its partnership with Sinn, and today makes up the majority of the “Aviation” collection. The BR01 is influenced by Sinn's major theme of practicality and quality, but the Bell & Ross mission is to make these kind of serious, practical instruments accessible to those with more concern for lifestyle and fashion. This can be seen in the BR01's urbane, ultra-legible dials and square cases that would not look out of place on an aircraft dashboard.

                            Hailing from a period before TAG’s acquisition of Heuer, the timepiece features the vintage Heuer symbol which has since been made popular again by vintage styled pilots watches.

Made specifically for pilots in the German air force, the Bundeswehr, this timepiece was a utilitarian watch that dates from the Cold War era. As the watches of choice of the German Airforce, who were tasked with the defence of Western Germany, this timepiece represents a tangible link to a compelling period in modern European history.

This Heuer timepiece is a premium example of a vintage pilot’s watch, featuring an ultra-legible dial that is specifically designed to be read in all lighting conditions. The timepiece features a fly back mechanism which is particularly useful for the synchronisation of timing between two aircraft and it bears a dial lumed with tritium, befitting of its vintage status.

                            Fascinating, innovative and technically unique, Jaeger-LeCoultre's Duometre watches are often overlooked despite being one of the most impressive collections in the brand's stable (no small achievement). The watches use a brilliant “dual wing” movement boasting two separate mainspring power sources. The first is used purely for the main time display, and the other caters to additional complications. In this case, the elegant dial showcases the hours and minutes symmetrically opposite a dial combining the date with a sophisticated dual-hemisphere moonphase display. There is a long seconds hand from the centre, while the 6 o'clock subdial features jumping sixths of a second. It's flanked by exquisite exhibition apertures into the movement's workings—including power reserve indicators for each of the “dual wing” sources.

                            Since its first release in 2000, Richard Mille has made the industry stand up and take note with its outlandish, mostly skeletonised watches. Blending design innovation with unorthodox materials, these timepieces are also tough enough to be worn by elite athletes in the thick of the action. Tennis player Rafa Nadal famously wears his on court. This incredible flyback chronograph deep sea dive model stands out among Richard Mille watches for its round, rather than tonneau, case. But all the other signature brand elements are there, including the lightweight titanium case, integrated rubber strap and skeletonization. Striking looks aside, this watch complies with ISO 6425 international dive watch requirements and is water-resistant to 300 metres. Its inwardly sloping bezel also features push-buttons at opposite sides that are held down simultaneously to move the bezel, which is otherwise locked for added safety. The automatic movement holds a power reserve of 45-50 hours, depending on whether the chronograph is running, and it also features an annual calendar. An attention-grabber thanks to its 50mm case size, it’s nonetheless a watch that excels technically.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy of providing racing drivers with high quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its very special Limited Edition carbon fibre dial and superb calibre 16 automatic chronograph movement, fitted with a special day and date function at 3 o'clock.

                            Known as one of the foremost purveyors of ultra-elegant jewellery, Cartier has long held a reputation for superb watches, mostly with excellent mechanical pedigree, but its principal strong suit has been high-fashion and style. The Calibre de Cartier collection represents a big step forward for the brand into the world of true haute horlogerie. Without losing an ounce of its customary sophistication and stylishness, the watches are equipped with the first self-winding movement entirely manufactured by Cartier SA: the glorious 1904 MC (named for the year that Louis Cartier famously made a wristwatch for pilot Alberto Santos-Dumont).

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. The watch builds on the heritage of the legendary Explorer I, which has always been a firm favourite among enthusiasts—the watch was first established in the public mind after its pioneering ascent of Everest during the expedition of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Today the Explorer II deviates in some ways from the original look, but it continues to represent an exceptional, hardy, modernised tool watch with a top-of-the-range in-house movement and a design that does justice to its legacy in both sports and adventure.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors.

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. The watch builds on the heritage of the legendary Explorer I, which has always been a firm favourite among enthusiasts—the watch was first established in the public mind after its pioneering ascent of Everest during the expedition of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Today the Explorer II deviates in some ways from the original look, but it continues to represent an exceptional, hardy, modernised tool watch with a top-of-the-range in-house movement and a design that does justice to its legacy in both sports and adventure.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors.

                            Introduced in 2013, the Blackbird is a seriously good looking update for Breitling's Avenger series, and a welcome new member of the brand's growing compendium of awesome “stealth” (black-on-black) pieces. The watch may be a reference to the equally cool, black and stealthy SR-71 Blackbird – a legendary US Air Force reconnaissance plane that played a key part in the Cold War. With its carbon-treated titanium case and comparatively slim profile, this Blackbird is as ergonomic and lightweight as its namesake. The dial is super legible and glare-proof, while the movement is based on a premium Swiss chronometer.

                            Before the legendary Calibre 360, which made headlines as the first mechanical chronograph movement capable of measuring hundredths of a second, there was the Calibre 36. Equally legendary, in its way, the 36 displays tenths of a second thanks to its super-high frequency of 5Hz (most high-end chronographs beat at 4Hz). This might remind you of another famous chronograph movement, and you'd be right: the Calibre 36 is a modified version of Zenith's El Primero – ironic, considering Heuer and Zenith were competitors in the famous 1969 race to build the first automatic chrono – although this one has been upgraded with additional flyback capability. This gorgeous, cutting-edge Carrera evolves the remarkable Mikrograph design with a darker ring encompassing a gloriously brushed anthracite centre.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they're among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79350, with a superb chronograph mechanism. While adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            Based in the historic watch-making German town from which it takes its name, Glashutte Original was a company that was absorbed into the collectivized VEB Glashutter Uhrenbetriebe group of watchmakers in the former communist East Germany. After the country’s reunification it re-launched and has been thriving ever since, along with its illustrious neighbour A. Lange & Sohne. This skeletonised edition of the Senator Manual model showcases its manually wound Calibre 49-18 movement, with almost every visible part of it embellished by the exquisite skills of the company’s hand engravers. Adding to the aesthetic beauty is a highly polished 42mm red gold case, within which is galvanized silver dial with black roman numerals and blued-steel leaf hands. The power reserve is a respectable 40 hours.

                            Since 1946, British aerospace company Martin-Baker has saved the lives of at least 7,450 pilots. That's because it makes ejection seats—one of the most vital pieces of safety equipment on any high-speed aircraft. Martin-Baker seats are the best of the best, tested to the most punishing levels of endurance and extremes of shock, vibration, temperature and more. Amazingly, Bremont's Martin-Baker watches have been put through the same rigours used on the ejection seats, at the same test facility. Fitted with anti-shock movement mounts and Faraday cages, the MB watches are made to be the ultimate endurance chronometer, able to survive just about anything short of a direct meteor strike. They're also not half handsome to look at.

                            The U-2 is one of the most important high tech spy planes in the US Airforce. Nicknamed the Dragon Lady, early versions of the U-2 were in operation at the beginning of the Cold War, and continue to be flown by exceptional pilots based in Beale, California. Needless to say, this is the type of aviation history that Bremont adores. The U-2 collection is a sincerely heartfelt tribute to these amazing machines and the brave souls who fly them, often over 80,000 feet into the stratosphere for 12 hours or more at a time. The beautifully designed U-2 watches have, like the plane, been tested at even higher altitudes, as well as at temperature extremes of -40ºC or more, including tests “in the field” with the U-2 pilots themselves. The watch's ultra-durable Trip-Tick case contains an inner bezel operated by a crown at 4 o'clock and comes with a DLC coating.

                            The Engineer Hydrocarbon is perhaps Ball's most impressive watch collection, at least in terms of cutting-edge technology and imposing designs. These timepieces are big, practical and good looking, and their engineering is as exquisite as any of the brand's watches. Ball has created several brilliant Hydrocarbons over the years, but arguably none quite as remarkable as the Spacemaster. This model is known for its incredible tritium micro gas tubes on the dial and hands that create a distinctive glow (in a range of colours) for increased ease of reading at night. The gas maintains its extraordinary luminescence for at least 25 years, and does not dim at night, unlike modern luminous paint. The watch also features a detailed engraving of an astronaut on the caseback.

                            The Maurice Lacroix Masterpiece collection was the company's first line of beautiful, high-end watches that used mechanical movements founded on the best Swiss traditions. In 2006, it also became the first collection to use its in-house manufacture movements, propelling the brand into the upper echelons of haute horlogerie. With its position as one of the finest boutique watchmakers in the industry now firmly secured, Maurice Lacroix has gone from strength to strength, and this piece is a magnificent example. Also using an in-house movement, the watch has been skeletonised to stunning effect. The “Squelette”, as it's called, uses the finest hand-crafted traditional workmanship to create a watch with a modern, innovative spirit.

                            Montblanc's watchmaking career took off in 1997, after a long history of making the finest quality pens and having already been absorbed into the Richemont Group along with the likes of IWC and Jaeger-LeCoultre. But the brand didn't get serious attention from the watch community until its acquisition of the historic and prestigious Minerva manufacture, which allowed it to create its own in-house movements and step fully into the limelight. The new 1858 collection, of which this is a stunning limited edition example, was conceived to celebrate Minvera's long history, with a design that beautifully captures the style of its 1930s inspiration.

                            Bell & Ross has long been passionate about military watches—unsurprising given its perpetual focus on bringing function and utility to the forefront of luxury watchmaking. Most of the brand's true military styles have been reserved for the Vintage collection, but some of the best pieces to receive its coveted “Military Type” label can in fact be found in the instrument series (BR01 and BR03), which was originally based on aircraft cockpit instruments. Bell & Ross state that these pieces pay tribute to the first professionals, historically, who relied on wristwatches. They display an authentic military awareness of a need for extreme legibility, both at day and night, as well as serious durability and precision.

                            Inspired by the men’s suit of the same name, this Longines Heritage Classic Tuxedo Chronograph pays tribute to the carefree nature of the late 1940s that came after the austerity of the Second World War. This piece, then, with its black and white concentric dial, embodies the sartorial style of that era, while remaining up to date with handy features such as the automatic calibre L895 and chronograph sub dials at 3 and 9 o’clock. The tachymeter scale is beautifully accented in blue, matching the hands of the small seconds and minutes registers, as well as the big seconds hand.  This Longines is an ideal watch for fans of vintage aesthetics but modern specs.

                            The U-2 is one of the most important high tech spy planes in the US Airforce. Nicknamed the Dragon Lady, early versions of the U-2 were in operation at the beginning of the Cold War, and continue to be flown by exceptional pilots based in Beale, California. Needless to say, this is the type of aviation history that Bremont adores. The U-2 collection is a sincerely heartfelt tribute to these amazing machines and the brave souls who fly them, often over 80,000 feet into the stratosphere for 12 hours or more at a time. The beautifully designed U-2 watches have, like the plane, been tested at even higher altitudes, as well as at temperature extremes of -40ºC or more, including tests “in the field” with the U-2 pilots themselves. The watch's ultra-durable Trip-Tick case contains an inner bezel operated by a crown at 4 o’clock.

                            Launched as part of the instrument series in the mid-00s, the Bell & Ross BR03 collection can be seen as the iconic BR01's smaller-cased brother. Like the bigger watch, the BR03 is all about utilitarian luxury, striving for extreme clarity, precision and reliability, designed for professionals as well as watch collectors. Its immediately recognisable square case and instrument-style appearance has put it at the centre of the brand's popularity, and the smaller size makes the BR03 more comfortable for many wearers. The Phantom version made waves as one of the first and most successful all-black luxury watches—the full effect of this incredible model has to be seen to be believed.

                            Launched as part of the instrument series in the mid-00s, the Bell & Ross BR03 collection can be seen as the iconic BR01's smaller-cased brother. Like the bigger watch, the BR03 is all about utilitarian luxury, striving for extreme clarity, precision and reliability, designed for professionals as well as watch collectors. Its immediately recognisable square case and instrument-style appearance has put it at the centre of the brand's popularity, and the smaller size makes the BR03 more comfortable for many wearers. The Phantom version made waves as one of the first and most successful all-black luxury watches—the full effect of this incredible model has to be seen to be believed.

                            The U-2 is one of the most important high tech spy planes in the US Airforce. Nicknamed the Dragon Lady, early versions of the U-2 were in operation at the beginning of the Cold War, and continue to be flown by exceptional pilots based in Beale, California. Needless to say, this is the type of aviation history that Bremont adores. The U-2 collection is a sincerely heartfelt tribute to these amazing machines and the brave souls who fly them, often over 80,000 feet into the stratosphere for 12 hours or more at a time. The beautifully designed U-2 watches have, like the plane, been tested at even higher altitudes, as well as at temperature extremes of -40ºC or more, including tests “in the field” with the U-2 pilots themselves. The watch's ultra-durable Trip-Tick case contains an inner bezel operated by a crown at 4 o’clock.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history. The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.

                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            Inspired by the men’s suit of the same name, this Longines Heritage Classic Tuxedo Chronograph pays tribute to the carefree nature of the late 1940s that came after the austerity of the Second World War. This piece, then, with its black and white concentric dial, embodies the sartorial style of that era, while remaining up to date with handy features such as the automatic calibre L895 and chronograph sub dials at 3 and 9 o’clock. The tachymeter scale is beautifully accented in blue, matching the hands of the small seconds and minutes registers, as well as the big seconds hand.  This Longines is an ideal watch for fans of vintage aesthetics but modern specs.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 diver conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its 300m water resistance, big date and chronograph functionality. Impressively, there's a tenth of a second counter at 6 o'clock, which is testament to the exceptional reliability and accuracy of the caliber inside.

                            Expanding on their hugely admired Heritage Black Bay series, Tudor released its Black Bay Fifty-Eight in 2018, inspired by the brand’s reference 7924 Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1958—hence the name. Previously released Black Bays, still in production, had bigger cases—41mm, or even 43mm for the bronze model—but at 39mm the Black Bay Fifty-Eight is noticeably smaller and will suit those with a smaller wrist. A classic steel dive watch with a retro feel, including the faux-aged lume and distinctive red triangle on the aluminium bezel, this is a COSC-certified chronometer with 200m water resistance and an in-house movement—unlike the earliest Black Bays. Increasingly sought-after, this is a future classic that has further enhanced Tudor’s reputation and allowed it to step out of the shadow of its older sibling, Rolex.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilot's watches. While the concept was successful and enjoyed various upgrades (including input from the legendary Gerald Genta), it was beginning to peter out in the early naughties. Seeking to refresh the collection, IWC partnered with Mercedes' high performance division, AMG, to create a series of cutting-edge timepieces that demonstrated both brands' commitment to the highest precision engineering. This model is made from zirconium-based ceramic, inspired by AMG's disc brakes, and houses the famous in-house Caliber 80110.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, and continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950’s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its lovely, paired-down tribute to vintage timepieces. The watch uses TAG's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features a modern version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

                            Sleek, menacing and black as night, the PAM 441's dark allure is not the result of any external PVD or DLC. It's a fully ceramic case, much harder than steel and amazingly durable, the result of an exceptionally long and arduous process of diamond-wheel machining and microglass blasting to achieve the gorgeous matt finish. The material is too hard to mould and is originally created by extreme isostatic pressing of zirconium oxide followed by sintering at around 1,500°C.

                            This gorgeous Portuguese Automatic has many excellent qualities, but perhaps the most interesting is the movement's power reserve. It's not just the impressive length of stored power, but also the technical ingenuity employed to go above and beyond the call of duty. The watch is engineered to come to an automatic stop after seven days, despite the fact that the actual power reserve is more like eight days. Why? This avoids relying on the last part of the mainspring's stored power, which would entail diminished torque and potential problems with consistent accuracy. When coupled with the Portuguese's handsome appearance and prestigious history, this watch is a very enticing offer indeed.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 diver conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its 300m water resistance, big date and chronograph functionality. Impressively, there's a tenth of a second counter at 6 o'clock, which is testament to the exceptional reliability and accuracy of the caliber inside.

                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            This gorgeous Portuguese Automatic has many excellent qualities, but perhaps the most interesting is the movement's power reserve. It's not just the impressive length of stored power, but also the technical ingenuity employed to go above and beyond the call of duty. The watch is engineered to come to an automatic stop after seven days, despite the fact that the actual power reserve is more like eight days. Why? This avoids relying on the last part of the mainspring's stored power, which would entail diminished torque and potential problems with consistent accuracy. When coupled with the Portuguese's handsome appearance and prestigious history, this watch is a very enticing offer indeed.

                            The Transocean collection is one of Breitling's most sophisticated and elegant. Inspired by 1950s and 60s chronograph designs, it brings the brand's unmatched sporting watch prowess to new audiences, powered by Breitling's remarkable chronograph movements. This Unitime Pilot features the company's superb world timer complication, first developed in the 1950s but now improved with in-house calibre B05 (based on the groundbreaking B01). The high-frequency automatic chronograph movement allows the wearer to shift time zones with incredible ease via the crown, which controls the cities, hour hands and 24-hour ring simultaneously.

                            Given the Big Bang's origins, with its porthole-inspired design, there have been nautical themes in the collection from the start—if faint ones. So when it came time for Hublot to create its first “serious” diving watch, it made some sense to turn to the King Power, the even bigger, bolder version of the already spectacular Big Bang series. Hublot was never going to do things by halves. Made of lightweight titanium, this “Oceanographic” has a beastly 48mm case distinguished by the monstrous crown at 2 o'clock (its marginally smaller brother at 4 o'clock is for the inner bezel), and a super-legible, lume-heavy dial. The crystal is a massive 6.5mm thick, providing the immense water resistance (4,000m) that would keep this extraordinary watch safe and sound on the ocean floor.

                            Expanding on their hugely admired Heritage Black Bay series, Tudor released its Black Bay Fifty-Eight in 2018, inspired by the brand’s reference 7924 Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1958—hence the name. Previously released Black Bays, still in production, had bigger cases—41mm, or even 43mm for the bronze model—but at 39mm the Black Bay Fifty-Eight is noticeably smaller and will suit those with a smaller wrist. A classic steel dive watch with a retro feel, including the faux-aged lume and distinctive red triangle on the aluminium bezel, this is a COSC-certified chronometer with 200m water resistance and an in-house movement—unlike the earliest Black Bays. Increasingly sought-after, this is a future classic that has further enhanced Tudor’s reputation and allowed it to step out of the shadow of its older sibling, Rolex.

                            Breitling's legendary Aerospace watches were originally unveiled in the mid-1980s as part of the Navitimer collection, created as the next step in the evolution of the brand's cutting-edge instruments for pilots. With the most accurate, high-tech Swiss superquartz movements on the market, the Aerospace was rapidly adopted by professionals as the ideal multi-function tool watch—its robust and lightweight titanium case and advanced analogue-digital display were also decisive factors in its popularity. Today, Aerospace models remain favourites for collectors and professionals alike, and they continue to provide the outstanding accuracy, reliability and legibility that have long made them so highly prized.

                            Introduced in 2013, the Blackbird is a seriously good looking update for Breitling's Avenger series, and a welcome new member of the brand's growing compendium of awesome “stealth” (black-on-black) pieces. The watch may be a reference to the equally cool, black and stealthy SR-71 Blackbird – a legendary US Air Force reconnaissance plane that played a key part in the Cold War. With its carbon-treated titanium case and comparatively slim profile, this Blackbird is as ergonomic and lightweight as its namesake. The dial is super legible and glare-proof, while the movement is based on a premium Swiss chronometer.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history (this piece is inspired by its twin-engined Model 247 airliner from the 1930s). The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.

                            This beautiful dress watch from Jaeger-LeCoultre is not just exceptionally well-designed, with a clean, easily readable face and gorgeous case proportions, it also represents phenomenal value for money on its movement, which features several intricate complications. The watch, released in 2014 and inspired by a vintage 1945 piece from the JLC archives, has a moonphase and a complete calendar with displays for date, day of the week, and month. With all this, it still manages to maintain a refined, minimalist aesthetic based around a highly uncluttered dial—in large part thanks to the uncommon pointer-type date display around the dial's circumference.

                            Expanding on their hugely admired Heritage Black Bay series, Tudor released its Black Bay Fifty-Eight in 2018, inspired by the brand’s reference 7924 Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1958—hence the name. Previously released Black Bays, still in production, had bigger cases—41mm, or even 43mm for the bronze model—but at 39mm the Black Bay Fifty-Eight is noticeably smaller and will suit those with a smaller wrist. A classic steel dive watch with a retro feel, including the faux-aged lume and distinctive red triangle on the aluminium bezel, this is a COSC-certified chronometer with 200m water resistance and an in-house movement—unlike the earliest Black Bays. Increasingly sought-after, this is a future classic that has further enhanced Tudor’s reputation and allowed it to step out of the shadow of its older sibling, Rolex.

                            Expanding on their hugely admired Heritage Black Bay series, Tudor released its Black Bay Fifty-Eight in 2018, inspired by the brand’s reference 7924 Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1958—hence the name. Previously released Black Bays, still in production, had bigger cases—41mm, or even 43mm for the bronze model—but at 39mm the Black Bay Fifty-Eight is noticeably smaller and will suit those with a smaller wrist. A classic steel dive watch with a retro feel, including the faux-aged lume and distinctive red triangle on the aluminium bezel, this is a COSC-certified chronometer with 200m water resistance and an in-house movement—unlike the earliest Black Bays. Increasingly sought-after, this is a future classic that has further enhanced Tudor’s reputation and allowed it to step out of the shadow of its older sibling, Rolex.

                            Bell & Ross has long been passionate about military watches—unsurprising given its perpetual focus on bringing function and utility to the forefront of luxury watchmaking. Most of the brand's true military styles have been reserved for the Vintage collection, but some of the best pieces to receive its coveted “Military Type” label can in fact be found in the instrument series (BR01 and BR03), which was originally based on aircraft cockpit instruments. Bell & Ross state that these pieces pay tribute to the first professionals, historically, who relied on wristwatches. They display an authentic military awareness of a need for extreme legibility, both at day and night, as well as serious durability and precision.

                            Celebrated Italian jeweller Bulgari has been making its own timepieces since 1980 but watches have always played an important role for the brand. Since it started developing its own calibres it has produced a number of impressively thin and complicated models, including tourbillons and minute repeaters, with many of these coming within the Octo range. This Octo model comes in rose gold and is paired with a fine alligator strap. The octagonal case—which has a distinctive layered design— harks back to the designs of Gerald Genta, whose brand Bulgari purchased in 2000. The skeletonised dauphine hands and baton markers are also rose gold, with Arabic numerals at 12 and 6 o’clock and a date aperture at 3 o’clock that’s small enough not to intrude on the delightfully clean dial. A transparent caseback reveals the BVL 193 automatic movement with 50-hour power reserve. There’s no better dress watch to pair with a tuxedo.

                            Grand Seiko continues to excel at the apex of Japanese watch-making with a sublime range of techniques and skills that exist nowhere else. The most remarkable aspect of this dress watch from its Elegance collection is the lacquer made from the sap of the urushi trees found under Mount Iwate in northern Japan. The lacquer is mixed with iron to give it its deep, jet-black colour. The GS logo and hour markers for 6 and 12 o’clock are individually crafted by a urushi master who builds up the lacquer to create a 3-D profile before coating with powdered gold and polishing. Within the 39mm 18k rose gold case you’ll find Grand Seiko’s manual-wind Caliber 9S63, which holds a 72-hour power reserve. It’s also limited to just 150 pieces.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            Calatrava began as a medieval order of religious knights; their emblem was to be adopted many centuries later by perhaps Switzerland's most prestigious and revered watchmaker of all time, Patek Philippe, as the brand logo (here seen on the strap clasp). Its flagship Calatrava watches are among the most elegant and distinguished in the world, as exemplified by this stunning commemorative edition for the company's 175th anniversary. Limited to just 400 pieces, the watch houses an upgraded in-house CH 28-520 movement with a multi-scale chronograph capable of computing a range of calculations (including pulsometer, telemeter and tachymeter), with a sweep chronograph hand that doubles as conventional seconds.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            Breitling’s Navitimer pilot’s watch boasts the proud distinction of being the first Swiss wristwatch and chronograph in space, having been worn by NASA astronaut Scott Carpenter while orbiting the Earth in 1962 on the Mercury-Atlas 7 mission. Launched in 1952, it’s now one of the most recognisable watches around, with its three-register dial ringed with a tachymeter scale and circular aviation slide rule. This particular version in 18k rose gold is limited to 159 pieces and features specially tinted SuperLuminova coating on the hands and numerals to add to the vintage look. It’s powered by the in-house Caliber B09 which holds a power reserve of 70 hours.

                            In 1884, in a small town up in the Jura mountains called St. Imier, Léon Breitling opened a workshop that specialised in high-precision scientific measuring and timing equipment. So good were his creations that their popularity demanded he relocate to a larger workshop, which he did in 1892. The new factory was on Montbrillant Street, La-Chaux-de-Fonds, and it remained there until 1979. Taking its name from this historic location where many watchmaking firsts occurred, the Breitling Montbrillant sources its visual inspiration from the aviator watches of the 1940s and 1950s that debuted and featured the famous Breitling slide rule. The Datora model, with its additional calendar complications, is inspired by a particularly successful piece from this period.

                            The Transocean collection is one of Breitling's most sophisticated and elegant. Inspired by 1950s and 60s chronograph designs, it brings the brand's unmatched sporting watch prowess to new audiences, powered by Breitling's remarkable chronograph movements. This Unitime Pilot features the company's superb world timer complication, first developed in the 1950s but now improved with in-house calibre B05 (based on the groundbreaking B01). The high-frequency automatic chronograph movement allows the wearer to shift time zones with incredible ease via the crown, which controls the cities, hour hands and 24-hour ring simultaneously.

                            Breitling's legendary Aerospace watches were originally unveiled in the mid-1980s as part of the Navitimer collection, created as the next step in the evolution of the brand's cutting-edge instruments for pilots. With the most accurate, high-tech Swiss superquartz movements on the market, the Aerospace was rapidly adopted by professionals as the ideal multi-function tool watch—its robust and lightweight titanium case and advanced analogue-digital display were also decisive factors in its popularity.

                            Breitling's legendary Aerospace watches were originally unveiled in the mid-1980s as part of the Navitimer collection, created as the next step in the evolution of the brand's cutting-edge instruments for pilots. With the most accurate, high-tech Swiss superquartz movements on the market, the Aerospace was rapidly adopted by professionals as the ideal multi-function tool watch—its robust and lightweight titanium case and advanced analogue-digital display were also decisive factors in its popularity. Today, Aerospace models remain favourites for collectors and professionals alike, and they continue to provide the outstanding accuracy, reliability and legibility that have long made them so highly prized.

                            The Transocean collection is one of Breitling's most sophisticated and elegant. Inspired by 1950s and 60s chronograph designs, it brings the brand's unmatched sports watch prowess to new audiences, powered by Breitling's remarkable chronograph movements. This limited edition Unitime Pilot features the company's superb world timer complication, first developed in the 1950s but now improved with in-house calibre B05 (based on the groundbreaking B01). The high-frequency automatic chronograph movement allows the wearer to shift time zones with incredible ease via the crown, which controls the cities, hour hands and 24-hour ring simultaneously.

                            In 1884, in a small town up in the Jura mountains called St. Imier, Léon Breitling opened a workshop that specialised in high-precision scientific measuring and timing equipment. So good were his creations that their popularity demanded that he relocated to a larger workshop, which he did in 1892. The new factory was on Montbrillant Street, La-Chaux-de-Fonds, and it remained there until 1979. Taking its name from this historic location where many watchmaking firsts occurred, the Breitling Montbrillant sources its visual inspiration from the aviator watches of the 1940s and 1950s that debuted the famous Breitling slide rule. This wonderful special edition, dubbed “100 years of aviation”, was made for the anniversary of the Wright brothers' landmark first flight in 1903.

                            The Rolex Explorer is one of the most highly valued and sough-after models in the world of vintage watch collecting. Originally based on the model worn by Tenzing Norgay in the first ever successful ascent of Everest in 1953, the famous ref 1016 Explorer was an evolution of two equally interesting preceding watches, the 6350 and 6610, and was manufactured from the late 60s to mid 80s. A versatile vintage timepiece that enjoyed numerous variations, the Explorer 1016 remains one of the best examples of Rolex's genius for combining sport and dress elements in their watches.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history (this piece is inspired by its twin-engined Model 247 airliner from the 1930s). The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.

                            Tudor has stepped out of the shadow of its older sister brand Rolex in recent years, offering watches that feature some of the hallmarks of its more illustrious sibling but at a more accessible price point. It forged its distinct personality largely by delving into its archives and reviving old models, including the Pelagos, a version of a Tudor Submariner from the 1970s. This left-hand winder is powered by an MT5612 in-house calibre, which replaced the ETA movement of previous Pelagos models. It bears the now-iconic Tudor ‘snowflake’ hands, echoed in the square indexes, and the date is displayed in the window at 3 o’clock. The 42mm case is a blend of steel and titanium, while the bezel—also titanium—is coated in matt black ceramic. A handsome and versatile divers’ watch, it is water resistant to 500 metres, boasts a helium escape valve at 3 o’clock and holds a 70-hour power reserve.

                            The Autavia is one of TAG Heuer’s several iconic sports chronographs that includes the Carrera and, more famously, the Monaco. Produced between the 1960s and the 1980s, it was inspired by the period dashboard instruments of racing cars and worn by drivers including Jo Siffert. This version combines a three-register chronograph with a GMT function and also features a ‘Pepsi’ bezel which has retained its vivid blue and red colours in this particular example from circa 1971. TAG Heuer brought back the Autavia line in 2016 after a long hiatus so this original vintage model, made long before Heuer merged with TAG (Techniques d’Avant Garde),  is highly sought-after among collectors of the brand. The watch runs on a Valjoux 724 manual winding movement, which is based on the same movement that powered early Rolex chronographs. A vintage perforated strap completes the motor-racing aesthetic of this wonderful timepiece.

                            There’s a reason Audemars Piguet is a member of the so-called Holy Trinity of watchmakers and it’s not for its sporty Royal Oak model, exceptional as it is. This model—named after its co-founder, Edward Auguste Piguet—is a reminder of the brand’s mastery of elegant watches with high complications. Reminiscent of the company’s pre-Royal Oak era, this platinum-cased rectangular dress watch features a manual wind movement with tourbillon, visible through the large aperture at 6 o’clock, while above it is a rectangle filled with a mesmerising gulloche pattern and the Audemars Piguet name beneath 12 o’clock. Odd numbers are represented by baton indices and even numbers by Breguet-style Arabic numerals, both of which are applied. Boasting a beautifully finished movement visible through the caseback, this is an exceptional timepiece by one of the world’s greatest watch brands.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilot's watches. While the concept was successful and enjoyed various upgrades (including input from the legendary Gerald Genta), it was beginning to peter out in the early naughties. Seeking to refresh the collection, IWC partnered with Mercedes' high performance division, AMG, to create a series of cutting-edge timepieces that demonstrated both brands' commitment to the highest precision engineering. This model is made from zirconium-based ceramic, inspired by AMG's disc brakes, and houses the famous in-house Caliber 80110.

                            You may have noticed the Hublot branding on Ferrari cars and drivers in recent years—this is of course the result of a powerful partnership that works two ways. Hublot has been creating extra special timepieces in honour of the legendary Italian carmaker, including its record-breaking “LaFerrari” watch that turned heads with a 50-day power reserve. This stunning Big Bang is only slightly less impressive. It's a visual treat, with the chequered carbon fibre bezel augmented by the strikingly skeletonised dial, tinted sapphire and Ferrari's stallion at 9 o'clock. The interior is no less amazing, boasting Hublot's groundbreaking in-house calibre, the UNICO, with tungsten rotor, flyback capability and three days of power.

                            Piaget was founded in 1874 and over the course of its history has earned a reputation as an accomplished manufacturer of ultra-thin movements, which they supplied to the likes of Rolex, Omega and Audemars Piguet for many years. Its elegant Altiplano line, which uses its very thinnest movements, includes what was once the world’s thinnest self-winding watch, the Ultimate 910P. That measured in at a wafer-like height of 4.3mm, while this Altiplano Skeleton model in a white gold 38mm case isn’t far behind at a super-slender 5.34mm. Its in-house calibre 1200S is stamped with the prestigious Geneva Seal and incorporates a platinum micro-rotor, visible through both sides of the case. The power reserve on this stunning dress watch is 44 hours.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            When Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the lunar module, codenamed ‘Eagle’, and onto the powdery surface of the moon, the Omega Speedmaster on his wrist became the legendary Moonwatch. Tested to the limits by NASA for the rigours of space flight, the Speedmaster had in fact been into space before the testing had even begun. In October 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra took his own personal Speedmaster on board Sigma 7 and orbited Earth a total of six times for the Mercury 7 mission. The Speedmaster continued to provide NASA astronauts with invaluable service for the Apollo 13 mission, when it was used to time the crucial burn that would return the astronauts safely to Earth.

                            This gorgeous Portuguese Automatic has many excellent qualities, but perhaps the most interesting is the movement's power reserve. It's not just the impressive length of stored power, but also the technical ingenuity employed to go above and beyond the call of duty. The watch is engineered to come to an automatic stop after seven days, despite the fact that the actual power reserve is more like eight days. Why? This avoids relying on the last part of the mainspring's stored power, which would entail diminished torque and potential problems with consistent accuracy. When coupled with the Portuguese's handsome appearance and prestigious history, this watch is a very enticing offer indeed.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history. The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, continuing Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense 'Carrera Panamerica' road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera has long been sought to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams. This addition to the Carrera collection fully embodies that racing heritage with its large 60-second chronograph counter, as well as racing-themed colouring and tachymeter scale on the bezel.

                            Before the legendary Calibre 360, which made headlines as the first mechanical chronograph movement capable of measuring hundredths of a second, there was the Calibre 36. Equally legendary, in its way, the 36 can count tenths of a second thanks to its super-high frequency of 5Hz (most high-end chronographs beat at 4Hz). This might remind you of another famous chronograph movement, and you'd be right: the Calibre 36 is a modified version of Zenith's El Primero—ironic, considering Heuer and Zenith were competitors in the famous 1969 race to build the first automatic chrono—although this one has been upgraded with additional flyback capability. This gorgeous, cutting-edge Carrera evolves the remarkable Mikrograph design with a silver ring encompassing a gloriously brushed anthracite centre.

                            This Panerai Radiomir is 1 of 1000 made and features a ‘tropical’ dial. 
The watch’s dial has been fashioned to resemble the patina seen on vintage Panerai watches which have suffered the effects of radioactive exposure. The Radiomir paint in the vintage watches emitted gamma rays, from the radioactive Radium, and aged the watch in a fashion which turned the originally black paint to a light brown colour. 
Brevetatto, the Italian for patented, is inscribed around the bezel and refers to the design of the watch which adheres to a vintage aesthetic, Panerai have used a 12-sided bezel like those found on prototype watches from the 1930’s.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilot's watches. Created by the legendary designer Gerald Genta in the 1970s, the watch was allegedly inspired by a diving helmet, giving Genta the relatively new idea of leaving the functional case elements like screws and bores exposed, instead of hiding them away. This modernist aesthetic was a huge success for IWC, and the Ingenieur has become a horological icon. The same principles are still evident in this stunning “Climate Action” limited edition made in support of The Climate Group, a non-profit campaigning for a low-carbon economy.

                            The U-2 is one of the most important high-tech spy planes in the US Airforce. Nicknamed the Dragon Lady, early versions of the U-2 were in operation at the beginning of the Cold War, and continue to be flown by exceptional pilots based in Beale, California. Needless to say, this is the type of aviation history that Bremont adores. The U-2 collection is a sincerely heartfelt tribute to these amazing machines and the brave souls who fly them, often over 80,000 feet into the stratosphere for 12 hours or more at a time. The beautifully designed U-2 watches have, like the plane, been tested at even higher altitudes, as well as at temperature extremes of -40ºC or more—including tests “in the field” with the U-2 pilots themselves. The watch's ultra-durable Trip-Tick case contains an inner bezel operated by a crown at 4 o'clock.

                            This exquisite Panerai gem is a masterclass in subtlety in fine watchmaking. At first glance, the watch seems not too dissimilar to other Luminor pieces, with its gorgeous vintage Italian aesthetic, beloved of so many collectors. But inside, the PAM 306 is powered by Panerai's in-house calibre P.2005, which boasts a magnificent 30-second tourbillon cage. Where other brands would have put the prestigious tourbillon on the dial, Panerai keeps it a subtle feature for true watch lovers to admire through the caseback—alongside the equally impressive six-day power reserve display. The watch is a titanium limited edition of just 150 pieces, and also features GMT and day/night indications, while the small dot in the 9 o'clock subdial shows the tourbillon's half-minute rotation.

                            First released in 2009, the original King Power is a sizeable watch at 48mm, making it a controversial piece that splits opinion, although it has attracted the attention of two incredibly famous sporting legends in Diego Maradona and Usain Bolt, elevating the watch’s appeal. This limited-edition King Power Tourbillon GMT is one of only 28 examples in existence, making it a perfect collector’s piece. With a hand-wound tourbillon GMT movement visible through the skeleton dial and a handy calendar in the 9 o’clock position, all sat within a porthole-shaped bezel, the King Power Tourbillon GMT Zirconium is a futuristic watch suitable for everyday wear.

                            From the brand that was founded by the Godfather of horology, Abraham-Louis Breguet, this remarkable model is a world-timer with a highly unusual instant jumping time-zone display covering 24 cities. The pusher at 8 o’clock is used to set the reference city, while the crown at 3 o’clock sets the time. Switching between two cities is simple, masking the complexity of the automatic movement within, which can be viewed through the transparent caseback. The watch also bears the hallmarks of this illustrious watchmaker, with classic Breguet Roman numerals and ‘pomme’ hands. The case is rose gold with an ornate fluted band and the dial is dominated by a map of the western hemisphere, with a day and night indicator between 3 o’clock and 4 o’clock. Windows at 12 and 6 o’clock reveal the date and the city to which the displayed time is set. This is one of the most luxurious travel watches around and a must for any serious Breguet collectors.

                            This rare and incredibly elegant perpetual calendar is a true technical marvel. It's not just the quantity of data it records, from the date (including a four-digit year display) to the moonphase (with separate indications for northern and southern hemispheres) and even the seriously impressive seven-day power reserve (indicated inside the 3 o'clock subdial). The most extraordinary part of the watch is in fact the humble—yet sophisticated—crown. Based on the original design by the legendary watchmaker Kurt Klaus, the entire watch is set by the single crown; all components are connected so that you don't have to redo each little display one by one.

                            IWC's Top Gun series stands as a tribute to the elite pilot's training centre for the US Marines in Miramar, California, immortalised by the iconic 1986 Tom Cruise motion picture. The design is built to recall the deck watches of the 1930s and 1940s, referencing IWC's history in pilot's watches.  This impressive watch also features an elaborate Top Gun engraving, stunning anthracite dial and an extra lightweight ceramic and titanium case made with zirconium oxide fired at temperatures approaching 2,000 degrees centigrade. The in-house calibre 51111 has a seven day power reserve, and the watch comes with a military style green textile strap.

                            IWC's Da Vinci collection pays homage to one of the most inventive thinkers of history, the Renaissance Italian genius who was actually one of Europe's earliest mechanical horologists. A number of da Vinci's inventions, while unable to be built during his lifetime, have since been incorporated into mechanical watches. IWC's first Da Vinci timepiece, from the 1960s, showcased some of the most advanced quartz technology ever made at the time. The collection was revived in the 1980s, this time featuring a spectacular mechanical movement with a perpetual calendar designed by the legendary Kurt Klaus. Since then, Da Vinci watches have achieved more world firsts and turned many heads. This beautiful, platinum, retro-flavoured “vintage” edition was inspired by one of the earliest models.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history. This exceptionally rare GMT limited edition, boasting an advanced aerospace-grade titanium case, was made exclusively for Royal Navy crew members who operate a Merlin helicopter—an image of which can be seen on the dial.

                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            The Big Bang has long been prized for its bold, uncompromising design and innovative use of new materials. Drawing on and expanding the porthole and fusion ideas of previous Hublot watches, the Big Bang was instantly hailed as outstanding when launched in 2005, and is now firmly established as one of the most iconic sports watches of the 21st century. But it wasn't until more recently that the watch really came into its own with the addition of Hublot's proprietary Unico movement, made entirely in-house. A major milestone for the brand, the Unico stars in a new series of Big Bangs with gorgeously skeletonised dials, such as the superb carbon fibre, flyback model on offer here.

                            Nicolas Rieussec was the first collection launched by Montblanc after the company took control of the prestigious Minerva manufacture in Villeret. The watches are named after the French inventor of the chronograph, which was originally a device that measured intervals by moving a pen in contact with rotating paper, drawing an arc as it went (hence the name chronograph, from the Greek for “time-writing”). The Nicolas Rieussec watches were also the first to house an in-house Montblanc movement, propelling the brand into the upper echelons of haute horlogerie. Matching tradition with innovation, this stunning watch is a monopusher column-wheel chrono, with a second timezone on the main dial paired with a day/night indicator that mirrors the date window.

Here we have a very special model, available in only 100 pieces worldwide, with a remarkable red-tinted crystal and a stunning, skeletonised dial. This unique King Power watch has a large ceramic case and sandblasted bezel.

                            Featuring the in-house calibre UN-170 movement, boasting an impressive power reserve of 170 hours, the Skeleton Tourbillon features advanced silicium technology. Released in 2014 after a standout display at Baselworld a year prior, the Skeleton Tourbillon Manufacture is an excellent example of a skeleton watch—down to the leaf-shaped hour and minute hands, whose tips are also skeletonised. As in the name, even the tourbillon itself is impressively skeletonised, being a first for the watchmaker. Ulysse Nardin even designed the tourbillon from scratch, opting out of simply skeletonising one of its existing movements. Perfect for collectors, being very rare, this stunning watch is limited to just 99 pieces in both white and rose gold.

                            Describing its aesthetic as elegant, simple and creative, Vacheron Constantin has continually aimed to enhance and reinvent the art of fine watchmaking since its introduction over 265 years ago, cementing its place within the top three watchmakers in the world. This Patrimony exists within a classic line of Traditionnelle watches, and features a stunning open-worked, skeletonised dial that perfectly shows off the beautiful inner workings of the calibre 1003 SQRH. This movement features 118 components and 18 jewels that oscillate at 28,800vph plus a 31-hour power reserve. The movement, fitted with a solid 22-karat gold oscillating rotor, is also certified with the Hallmark of Geneva. With its striking white gold dial, bezel and black alligator strap, this watch is a bonafide head-turner.

                            The Big Bang has long been prized for its bold, uncompromising designs and innovative use of new materials. Drawing on and expanding the porthole and fusion ideas of previous Hublot watches, the Big Bang was instantly hailed as outstanding when launched in 2005, and is now firmly established as one of the most iconic sports watches of the 21st century. The watches are known not just for their eye-catching, stylish designs, but also for their sense of fun and the fact that they are not afraid to move beyond aesthetics associated with “traditional” or historic watchmaking. This bright and delightfully skeletonised “Aero Bang” edition, limited to just 500 pieces, features a superb ceramic case.

                            The Big Bang has long been prized for its bold, uncompromising designs and innovative use of new materials. Drawing on and expanding the porthole and fusion ideas of previous Hublot watches, the Big Bang was instantly hailed as outstanding when launched in 2005, and is now firmly established as one of the most iconic sports watches of the 21st century. The watches are known not just for their eye-catching, stylish designs, but also for their sense of fun and the fact that they are not afraid to move beyond aesthetics associated with “traditional” or historic watchmaking. This stunning limited edition model boasts a sleek ceramic case and a striking dark design with vivid red highlights.

                            This is an especially rare and unusual complication from the ultra-prestigious and highly prized manufacture Arnold & Son, and in fact hails from the brand's most exclusive watch series, the Instrument collection. The DBG is a fascinating watch that is inspired by two historical masterpieces by John Roger Arnold, son of the legendary London watchmaker of the same name who, together with Breguet, invented watchmaking as we know it today.

The aim was to build a watch capable of showing two time zones simultaneously, with the ability to set quarter- or half-hour differences. This was a major technical problem for watchmakers, because the gearing in a movement does not allow completely independent adjustment. Arnold solved the issue by installing a second barrel, gear train and escapement, completely separate from the main movement. This is the same system used in this DBG, which has two symmetrically arranged mechanical halves, partially visible on the dial, as well as two main displays. The small subdial at 12 o'clock shows the two systems' equation of time.

                            Corum has launched a number of highly unusual designs since its launch in 1955, with notable models including its heritage coin watches—made using real gold coins—and even a watch with a dial coated in a genuine bird’s feather. Its first Golden Bridge model was launched in 1980 and the collection is characterised by a baguette-shaped manual movement that spans the dial from top to bottom and is displayed through the transparent dial and caseback. It remains a unique construction in the world of fine watchmaking and is one of the most striking skeleton dials around. The tonneau-shaped case is made from yellow gold and the crown is located at the bottom of the case rather than the side, adding to its highly unorthodox aesthetic.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history (this piece is inspired by its twin-engined Model 247 airliner from the 1930s). The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.

                            This Panerai Radiomir is 1 of 1000 made and features a ‘tropical’ dial. 
The watch’s dial has been fashioned to resemble the patina seen on vintage Panerai watches which have suffered the effects of radioactive exposure. The Radiomir paint in the vintage watches emitted gamma rays, from the radioactive Radium, and aged the watch in a fashion which turned the originally black paint to a light brown colour. 
Brevetatto, the Italian for patented, is inscribed around the bezel and refers to the design of the watch which adheres to a vintage aesthetic, Panerai have used a 12-sided bezel like those found on prototype watches from the 1930’s.

                            Panerai has a long history of making stylish and super-reliable watches for professional divers, beginning with its famed WW2 contract for the Italian Navy's “Frogmen”. The PAM Submersible pieces are among Panerai's finest diving tools, and this one is particularly remarkable. While the watch runs on a superb Swiss mechanical movement, an electronic module has also been fitted. Consisting of a pressure transducer, microprocessor, lithium battery and other components, it acts as a depth gauge, allowing wearers to measure their distance below the surface on a three-part scale around the outside of the dial. The movement has achieved COSC certification, and so too the depth gauge has been independently tested and certified by the Swiss Federal Office for Metrology (METAS).

                            This Hublot King Power is 1 of 500 and is fashioned out of black ceramic. 

The watch features a foudroyant at 3 o’clock on the dial, this is a complication that counts 1/8th of a second. The timepiece also features a rattrapante or a split-second chronograph which can be accessed using a pusher built into crown. At 48 mm this Hublot King Power is the epitome of an oversized watch, the timepiece maintains a classically Hublot aesthetic with the porthole inspired casing and the H patterned Hublot bezel bolts. The blackening of the main dial and sub dials sacrifice legibility for style, and the monolithic black impression of the watch certainly leaves an impression.

                            This special limited edition Panerai Luminor pays tribute to some of the brand's vintage early 20th century models when Panerai was making watches for the Italian and Egyptian Navies. At this time, certain rare models had the words “Marina Militare” and “8 giorni brevettato” (“8 days patented”), which have been replicated here. In addition, the 339 was the first watch to feature Panerai's special ceramic case material. It's called “composite” instead of ceramic to differentiate it from the ceramics of other watchmakers, which are typically made with a zirconium base. Panerai's is made by electrochemical processes using aluminium, making it harder and tougher than other ceramics, not to mention lighter than even titanium. The in-house P.2000/7 movement has an impressive power reserve of eight days, a nod to the original ""8 giorni brevettato"".

                            Released in 2014, the Hublot Classic Fusion Tourbillon Night-Out is described as Hublot’s evening watch. This Night-Out in particular is a glitzy showstopper, as opposed to the original more pared down Night-Out. It boasts a diamond paved dial and rose gold bezel set with even more diamonds and a tourbillon, visible at 6 o’clock, making for a striking design element which is also visible on the sapphire case back. A spin off from the original Classic Fusion introduced in 1980, with its port hole inspired bezel, the Night-Out adds some exciting features to Hublot’s more understated and minimalistic original Classic Fusion line.

                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            The first AMVOX was launched in 2004 by Jaeger-LeCoultre in partnership with legendary carmaker Aston Martin. While this brand's initials account for the first two letters of the AMVOX acronym, the “vox” part refers to JLC's iconic 1950s Memovox diving watch, which was known for its extraordinary alarm function. Created by design genius Francis Cretin, the watch was made with more than passing echoes of the glorious Memovox (especially the Polaris model), while simultaneously introducing ideas from Aston Martin dashboards. This superb, more recent limited edition is the fifth of the AMVOX models, and boasts a prestigious world timer complication.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            This remarkable Audemars Piguet perpetual calendar in platinum was created to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the brand's reference 25548 model, which was released in 1978 and helped keep its tradition of haute horlogerie alive during the quartz era. Limited to just 90 pieces, it bears all the hallmarks of high-end Swiss watchmaking, with hand-finishing throughout, from the movement components to the noticeably thin case and its brushed steel sides. On the metallic blue sunburst dial are four registers that show both the triple calendar and leap year indicator, as well as the moon phase. Through the exhibition caseback you’ll find a spectacular winding rotor that is both skeletonised and hand-engraved while the bridges bear classic Geneva stripes. This is Audemars Piguet at its finest.

                            Named after the village of Le Brassus in the Vallee de Joux where Blancpain makes some of its most complicated timepieces, this stunning split-second chronograph from Switzerland’s oldest watchmaker comes in an exquisite rose gold case, matched by the dial’s Roman numerals and ‘feuille’ hands.  A power reserve indicator is positioned at 12 o’clock, while a date aperture is discreetly placed at 6 o’clock. The automatic movement can be viewed through the exhibition caseback and features a skeletonised, engraved rotor with the letter ‘B’ at its centre. This is a chance to own a highly elegant chronograph at the dressier end of the spectrum, from one of Switzerland’s most prestigious watch brands.

                            Founded in 1846 but revived in the 1980s after a period of dormancy brought on by the quartz crisis, Ulysse Nardin is a hallowed watchmaker that made its name with extremely accurate marine chronometers. These days its known for producing technological wonders such as the Freak and astronomical watches like the Planetarium Copernicus. Its El Toro collection brings an element of fun and colour to high-end watchmaking, combining a GMT function with a perpetual calendar that also, unusually, displays the year—all of which comes via an idiosyncratic layout on the deep red dial. The case is platinum with a black ceramic 24-hour bezel and features a sapphire caseback—which bears the words ‘Boca Raton, Concourse d’Elegance’, after the classic car event—revealing the automatic Caliber UN-32  movement within. This watch is limited to just 500 pieces.

                            Hublot burst onto the Swiss watchmaking scene in 1980 with the most groundbreaking new design that the industry had seen in years. The idea was simple: a luxury gold watch made in the bold “porthole” style, but fitted with a rubber bracelet. The idea of “Fusion” was born—and innovative combinations of materials have remained a key part of the Hublot brand ever since. This extra special piece harks back to Fusion with a glorious skeletonised design that allows for a spectacular view of the ultra-thin movement and its 90-hour power reserve. As ever, the materials are remarkable: there's a stunning titanium case, bezel and screws, a ruthenium anthracite mainplate and bridges, all paired with a fine leather strap.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, and continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950’s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its lovely, paired-down tribute to vintage timepieces. The watch uses TAG's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features a modern version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

                            This technically superlative Ingenieur from IWC features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph, one of the most difficult and challenging mechanical complications in high-end watchmaking. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden behind the other; an extra pusher at 10 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other seconds hand continues to run. As well as being mechanically impressive, this Double Chrono is also an imposing wear, with a large titanium case and bezel, five ceramic screws and a rubber-coated crown and pushers—all materials inspired by IWC's partnership with the Mercedes Formula One team.

                            IWC's Da Vinci collection pays homage to one of the most inventive thinkers of history, the Renaissance Italian genius who was actually one of Europe's earliest mechanical horologists. A number of da Vinci's inventions, while unable to be built during his lifetime, have since been incorporated into mechanical watches. IWC's first Da Vinci timepiece, from the 1960s, showcased some of the most advanced quartz technology ever made at the time. The collection was revived in the 1980s, this time featuring a spectacular mechanical movement with a perpetual calendar designed by the legendary Kurt Klaus. Since then, Da Vinci watches have achieved more world firsts and turned many heads. This beautiful, platinum, retro-flavoured “vintage” edition was inspired by one of the earliest models.

                            The Royal Oak Offshore, released in 1993, certainly raised eyebrows due to its hefty case size of 42mm, so much so it was quickly nicknamed ‘The Beast’. This special-edition 2007 release of the Alinghi Royal Oak Offshore is limited to 2,007 pieces. Made of platinum and forged carbon, it makes for an interesting redesign of the original Offshore and was created to celebrate the Alinghi sailing team’s victory, after which Audemars Piguet invited representatives of the international press to Valencia to unveil its exciting new creation. Developed with brilliant shock and water resistance and featuring a flyback chronograph function as well as a 10-minute countdown, this timepiece is purpose-built to keep in with the 11-minute race start rule. The dial perfectly echoes the nautical world, with counter hands shaped like the prow of a ship and the Alinghi logo at 3 o’clock. This timepiece is perfect for collectors and fans of watches and sailing alike.

                            Before the legendary Calibre 360, which made headlines as the first mechanical chronograph movement capable of measuring hundredths of a second, there was the Calibre 36. Equally legendary, in its way, the 36 can count tenths of a second thanks to its super-high frequency of 5Hz (most high-end chronographs beat at 4Hz). This might remind you of another famous chronograph movement, and you'd be right: the Calibre 36 is a modified version of Zenith's El Primero—ironic, considering Heuer and Zenith were competitors in the famous 1969 race to build the first automatic chrono—although this one has been upgraded with additional flyback capability. This gorgeous, cutting-edge Carrera evolves the remarkable Mikrograph design with a silver ring encompassing a gloriously brushed anthracite centre.

                            Part of the Portugieser family—one of IWC’s flagship models originally released in 1939—the IWC Portuguese Tourbillon Mystere 5042 was later released between 2008 and 2009. This piece features an automatic movement beating at a frequency of 19800 bph, which provides a 168-hour power reserve once fully wound. With a tourbillon escapement at 12 o’clock, and a date display in a stylish arc that reaches from the three to the six on a 31-day indicator, this special limited-edition Portuguese features a white gold case with an ardoise-coloured dial. With only 500 pieces ever made, it is a rarity, perfect for collectors.

                            Patek Philippe’s Grand Complications collection prides itself on displaying the brand's expertise in all horological complications. This includes tourbillons, grande and petite sonnerie striking mechanisms, minute repeaters, perpetual calendars (this takes account of monthly variations, including those in leap years), moon phases, and split-second chronographs. Patek have even managed to build the world’s most complicated portable timepiece this century on two separate occasions. The 5940 was introduced at Basel World 2012, and originally featured a yellow gold cushion-shaped case. Its self-winding calibre 240 Q movement displays the day, date, month, leap year and 24-hour indication by hands. In 2017 the reference 5940R-001 was added to the collection, featuring an updated rose gold case.

                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilot's watches. Created by the legendary designer Gerald Genta in the 1970s, the watch was allegedly inspired by a diving helmet, giving Genta the relatively new idea of leaving the functional case elements like screws and bores exposed, instead of hiding them away. This modernist aesthetic was a huge success for IWC, and the Ingenieur has become a horological icon. The same principles are still evident in this stunning “Climate Action” limited edition made in support of The Climate Group, a non-profit campaigning for a low-carbon economy.
