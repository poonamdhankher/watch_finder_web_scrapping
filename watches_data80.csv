                            Panerai has a long history of making stylish and super-reliable watches for professional divers, beginning with its famed WW2 contract for the Italian Navy's “Frogmen”. The PAM Submersible pieces are among Panerai's finest diving tools, and this one is particularly remarkable. While the watch runs on a superb Swiss mechanical movement, an electronic module has also been fitted. Consisting of a pressure transducer, microprocessor, lithium battery and other components, it acts as a depth gauge, allowing wearers to measure their distance below the surface on a three-part scale around the outside of the dial. The movement has achieved COSC certification, and so too the depth gauge has been independently tested and certified by the Swiss Federal Office for Metrology (METAS).

                            This Hublot King Power is 1 of 500 and is fashioned out of black ceramic. 

The watch features a foudroyant at 3 o’clock on the dial, this is a complication that counts 1/8th of a second. The timepiece also features a rattrapante or a split-second chronograph which can be accessed using a pusher built into crown. At 48 mm this Hublot King Power is the epitome of an oversized watch, the timepiece maintains a classically Hublot aesthetic with the porthole inspired casing and the H patterned Hublot bezel bolts. The blackening of the main dial and sub dials sacrifice legibility for style, and the monolithic black impression of the watch certainly leaves an impression.
