                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            The Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore, first introduced in 1993 and designed by Emmanuel Gueit, takes the bold nature of the Royal Oak to the next level. It's the brand's sportiest collection, featuring large case sizes and striking or exaggerated designs. Often described as “larger-than-life”, the Offshore is visually impressive, with dramatic design cues that exaggerate and heighten those of its predecessor. The watch develops ideas from the original Royal Oak, pioneered by the legendary Gerald Genta in 1972. This is a remarkable example of one of the most iconic collections from an ultra-prestigious Swiss brand.

                            Patrouille Suisse is the acclaimed aerobatics team of the Swiss Air Force. Flying since 1964, the team was known for its Hawker Hunter aircraft until the 1990s, when it switched to the Northrop F-5Es that it currently uses. There are many partnerships between aerobatics teams and watch companies, but perhaps none more perfect than this of Patrouille Suisse and Breitling, the Swiss watchmaking giant known for its prestigious history of pilots watches. This piece is indeed a limited edition Chronomat, sharing a name with one of the earliest and most influential Breitling watches in the second half of the 20th century. Featuring a special patch in the 9 o'clock subdial, and using a superb Swiss movement with an automatic chronograph and a second time zone, this watch celebrates Patrouille Suisse's 50th anniversary.

                            Created by Gerald Genta and like many of his famous watches, the Nautilus is a horological legend. Patek Philippe's most well known and desirable sports watch, it's celebrated for some of the best examples of emblematic Genta trademarks: large, angular bezel, comparatively thin case, integrated bracelet and bold, if straightforward, dial. The design is based on the traditional shape of portholes, up to and including the hinges often found on the sides—hence the Nautilus' unmistakable 'ears'. This model brings extra appeal in the form of a stunning movement with several additional complications: a small seconds, a power reserve indicator, and most impressively, a combined date and moonphase display.

                            This watch is not just a classic Submariner—one of the most popular and iconic watches in the world—but a striking and highly collectible variant edition. The watch is easily recognisable thanks to its rare green bezel and dial, causing collectors to give it the affectionate nickname “Hulk”, although LV itself stands for Lunette Vert (“Green Bezel”). This larger version updates the previous LV model ref 16610 (called “Kermit”) that was originally introduced in 2003 for the 50th anniversary of the Submariner. This edition boasts ceramic inserts in the bezel, with numerals in platinum.

                            The Royal Oak is one of the most iconic watches in history – a product of the same genius designer, Gerald Genta, who was responsible for the likes of Patek Philippe's Nautilus and IWC's Ingenieur. The story is a dramatic one – Audemars Piguet had been lingering on the edge of collapse since the Depression, but the unprecedentedly bold lines, steel case and luxury pricing turned Genta's creation into an enormous success that saved the prestigious company. The Offshore collection, meanwhile, was designed by Emmanuel Gueit in 1993, and represents the next step in the evolution of the brand's signature creation. While sticking to the classic elements of the original Royal Oak, the Offshore takes its bold nature even further.

                            The Speedmaster is so closely associated with NASA and the Moon landings these days that it's easy to forget that when it was first released in the 1950s, it was not remotely intended for space travel. Rather, as the name suggests, the Speedy was designed as a sports watch for timing things like motor racing. Certain models, both vintage and modern, have re-established that link somewhat, including a number of “racing” editions with checkered patterns on the dials resembling finish flags. This wonderful example made a big splash at Baselworld 2013 and has been nicknamed “Tintin”, because of its red and white pattern, directly inspired by the spaceship used by the comic book hero to go to the Moon.

                            The Alinghi team, under the colours of the Swiss yacht club, made history in 2003 when it challenged for and won the ultra-prestigious America's Cup in Aukland (a.k.a. “City of Sails”) on its first attempt. Audemars Piguet, which had sponsored the previous Swiss team Be Happy, also got behind Alinghi, releasing a number of very special limited edition watches, including this marvellous and highly collectible Royal Oak, in honour of the event. The piece also commemorates the 30th anniversary of the legendary Royal Oak itself, one of the most celebrated watch designs to emerge in the second half of the 20th century.

                            This masterful Luminor 1950 from Panerai features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph (also known as a rattrapante), one of high-end watchmaking's most challenging mechanical complications to manufacture. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden; an extra pusher at 8 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other hand continues to run. The PAM 213 uses the OP XVIII movement, based on a stunning and unusual column wheel Valjoux 7750.
