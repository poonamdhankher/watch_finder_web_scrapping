                            Named after the village of Le Brassus in the Vallee de Joux where Blancpain makes some of its most complicated timepieces, this stunning split-second chronograph from Switzerland’s oldest watchmaker comes in an exquisite rose gold case, matched by the dial’s Roman numerals and ‘feuille’ hands.  A power reserve indicator is positioned at 12 o’clock, while a date aperture is discreetly placed at 6 o’clock. The automatic movement can be viewed through the exhibition caseback and features a skeletonised, engraved rotor with the letter ‘B’ at its centre. This is a chance to own a highly elegant chronograph at the dressier end of the spectrum, from one of Switzerland’s most prestigious watch brands.

                            Founded in 1846 but revived in the 1980s after a period of dormancy brought on by the quartz crisis, Ulysse Nardin is a hallowed watchmaker that made its name with extremely accurate marine chronometers. These days its known for producing technological wonders such as the Freak and astronomical watches like the Planetarium Copernicus. Its El Toro collection brings an element of fun and colour to high-end watchmaking, combining a GMT function with a perpetual calendar that also, unusually, displays the year—all of which comes via an idiosyncratic layout on the deep red dial. The case is platinum with a black ceramic 24-hour bezel and features a sapphire caseback—which bears the words ‘Boca Raton, Concourse d’Elegance’, after the classic car event—revealing the automatic Caliber UN-32  movement within. This watch is limited to just 500 pieces.

                            Hublot burst onto the Swiss watchmaking scene in 1980 with the most groundbreaking new design that the industry had seen in years. The idea was simple: a luxury gold watch made in the bold “porthole” style, but fitted with a rubber bracelet. The idea of “Fusion” was born—and innovative combinations of materials have remained a key part of the Hublot brand ever since. This extra special piece harks back to Fusion with a glorious skeletonised design that allows for a spectacular view of the ultra-thin movement and its 90-hour power reserve. As ever, the materials are remarkable: there's a stunning titanium case, bezel and screws, a ruthenium anthracite mainplate and bridges, all paired with a fine leather strap.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, and continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950’s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its lovely, paired-down tribute to vintage timepieces. The watch uses TAG's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features a modern version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

                            This technically superlative Ingenieur from IWC features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph, one of the most difficult and challenging mechanical complications in high-end watchmaking. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden behind the other; an extra pusher at 10 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other seconds hand continues to run. As well as being mechanically impressive, this Double Chrono is also an imposing wear, with a large titanium case and bezel, five ceramic screws and a rubber-coated crown and pushers—all materials inspired by IWC's partnership with the Mercedes Formula One team.
