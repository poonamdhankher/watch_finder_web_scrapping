                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            It may be known for its iconic aviation watches that have led the industry for decades, but Breitling is more than adept when it comes to good-looking, functional horological tools of other kinds. Many Breitling diving watches are masterful pieces of engineering; the Superocean is surely the greatest example. The first Superocean was unveiled in the 1950s, made for professional and military use. More recently, the Superocean Heritage collection pays tribute to these superb timepieces with a design based on the original, though the technical specs have of course been upgraded to the highest modern standards. This clean and elegant model boasts 200m water resistance and a superb Swiss calibre.

                            While it's the limited, historical or complicated pieces that often get most of the attention when it comes to Panerai, many collectors are more interested in the more straightforward “Base” models, where they feel that the real essence of the brand can be found. These entry level watches come without distracting bells and whistles, at a comparatively affordable price point, yet they still have all of Panerai's best attributes in spades. Case in point is this lovely PAM560, one of five new Base models in 2014. It's very similar to its predecessor, the PAM112, with one major difference: inside beats the company's amazing in-house movement, Calibre P.5000, complete with double barrelled 8-day power reserve.

                            Fascinating, innovative and technically unique, Jaeger-LeCoultre's Duometre watches are often overlooked despite being one of the most impressive collections in the brand's stable (no small achievement). The watches use a brilliant “dual wing” movement boasting two separate mainspring power sources. The first is used purely for the main time display, and the other caters to additional complications. In this case, the elegant dial showcases the hours and minutes symmetrically opposite a dial combining the date with a sophisticated dual-hemisphere moonphase display. There is a long seconds hand from the centre, while the 6 o'clock subdial features jumping sixths of a second. It's flanked by exquisite exhibition apertures into the movement's workings—including power reserve indicators for each of the “dual wing” sources.

                            Since 1946, British aerospace company Martin-Baker has saved the lives of at least 7,450 pilots. That's because it makes ejection seats—one of the most vital pieces of safety equipment on any high-speed aircraft. Martin-Baker seats are the best of the best, tested to the most punishing levels of endurance and extremes of shock, vibration, temperature and more. Amazingly, Bremont's Martin-Baker watches have been put through the same rigours used on the ejection seats, at the same test facility. Fitted with anti-shock movement mounts and Faraday cages, the MB watches are made to be the ultimate endurance chronometer, able to survive just about anything short of a direct meteor strike. They're also not half handsome to look at.
