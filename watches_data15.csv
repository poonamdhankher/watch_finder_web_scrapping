                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history – none more so than this special edition celebrating Boeing's centenary. Carbon fibre from the famed Boeing Dreamliner testbed aircraft, ZA004, has been integrated into the watch's crown, while the case is made of advanced aerospace-grade titanium. Boeing's first widely used logo from the 1930s can be found on the dial.

                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            For many Panerai collectors, the “Base” Luminor models are considered an excellent purchase, as they tend to represent fantastic value for money and many are rare thanks to their small production runs. This model, for example, was made in only 2,000 units sold exclusively at boutique stores. The Base watches are similar if not identical in many respects to other models that cost far more. The key difference is the hour numerals, which are painted rather than cut out of a sandwich dial. While sandwiches are more closely identified with Panerai and arguably more authentic, many prefer the look and feel of the painted version, which is said to “pop” better than its counterpart.

                            The highly anticipated Rio Olympics are fast approaching, and naturally they have provided good cause for Omega to celebrate its enduring position as Official Timekeeper with a range of superb new special watches. This colourful limited edition is a take on the brand's legendary, ultra-rare 1969 “Bullhead” stopwatch. The name, of course, is derived from the unusual positioning of the crown and pushers on the top of the case. This stunning vintage reproduction stays faithful in most respects to the look of the original, with its distinctive wedge-shaped case and the 6 o'clock crown (which controls the internal bezel). The biggest change is the Olympic-themed colour scheme, and of course the fantastic modern movement 3113.

                            In 2014, when Jaguar announced it was making the six “remaining” Lightweight versions of the iconic E-Type (the gorgeous 60s model described as the most beautiful car ever made), it partnered with another British high-end brand, Bremont, to release six very special accompanying timepieces. Due to popular demand, these watches have since gone into production and the Jaguar has become a beloved member of the Bremont stable. Its success stems from its stunning use of E-Type design codes, from the Dunlop tyre tread on the crown to the Jaguar heritage logo, to the tachometer-inspired dial design with the same font and “red line quadrant” as the original cars.

                            Ayrton Senna was one of the most gifted racing drivers of all time. Tragically killed in an accident at the San Marino Grand Prix when he was 34, Senna made his name with his terrific skill, three world championships and notorious rivalries, and his legend endures to this day. The great man is honoured by this extraordinary all-ceramic Hublot limited edition, featuring his Brazilian colours on the dial (as well as a flag on the side of the case), and the Ayrton Senna Institute logo on the caseback. As an energetic Formula 1 tribute with an explosive design and build, the watch features amazing complications, including an impressive split seconds chronograph and the foudroyante (jumping) eighth of a second subdial.

                            Luxury watchmaking in England was given a welcome boost with the launch of Bremont in 2002. Founded by brothers Giles and Nick English, it began by making beautifully crafted pilots’ watches, most of which are ISO chronometer rated, and has brought out a number of intriguing limited editions that incorporate history into the actual watch in the most literal sense. This model features an actual piece of fabric used on the 1903 Wright Flyer aircraft that marked the beginning of the pioneer era of aviation. It can be seen through the transparent caseback, as can the automatic movement, which is powered by a rotor that bears the words ‘Wright Flyer’, the initials of the Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville, and a delightful propellor design. This hugely collectible watch, with a 50-hour power reserve, is one of just 300 pieces.

                            Still based in the alpine village of Le Locle where it was founded in 1865, Zenith has become inseparably associated with pioneering aviation watches. In 1909, father of aviation Louis Blériot wore a Zenith timepiece when he became the first man to fly the English Channel—in many respects, the DNA of that original pilot's watch has changed little. The Montre d'Aeronef watch itself was born in the 1930s as a cockpit clock, a vital tool for pilots through many generations. This modern example uses many design elements from these historic timepieces with very few changes—although it is, of course, equipped with a superb modern, in-house Elite movement complete with a classic GMT complication. How better to capture Zenith's extraordinary legacy of horology for pilots?

                            Before the legendary Calibre 360, which made headlines as the first mechanical chronograph movement capable of measuring hundredths of a second, there was the Calibre 36. Equally legendary, in its way, it boasts a super-high frequency of 5Hz (most high-end chronographs beat at 4Hz). This might remind you of another famous chronograph movement, and you'd be right: the Calibre 36 is a modified version of Zenith's El Primero—ironic, considering Heuer and Zenith were competitors in the famous 1969 race to build the first automatic chrono—although this one has been upgraded with additional flyback capability. This gorgeous, cutting-edge Carrera has been called the “hero model” of the Calibre 36 range, thanks to its titanium case and sleek black titanium carbide exterior.
