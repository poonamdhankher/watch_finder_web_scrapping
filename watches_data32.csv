                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            One of the most iconic vintage watches of the 20th century, the Heuer Monaco achieved a legendary status primarily for three reasons: for its innovative, square-cased design; for being the first watch to house the famous calibre 11, one of the very first automatic chronograph movements in history; and for its association with cult actor Steve McQueen, who wore the watch during the filming of the great 1972 motorsports film Le Mans, personifying the timeless cool of the classic race car era. This superb modern Monaco model remains exceptionally faithful to the original style of the watch's heyday.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 diver conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its 300m water resistance, big date and chronograph functionality. Impressively, there's a tenth of a second counter at 6 o'clock, which is testament to the exceptional reliability and accuracy of the caliber inside.

                            There are many travellers watches with GMT complications, but having an alarm function accompanying it on a gorgeous mechanical timepiece like this is considerably more rare. The alarm function has an intuitive setting system via one of the dual crowns, and produces a distinctive buzzing sound. Many watches with an extra time zone display can start to look cluttered, but this phenomenal timepiece retains its stylish Panerai look with a brilliant design that places the GMT indication in a subtle 24-hour wheel window in the bottom of the dial. All this is thanks to the extraordinary Girard-Perregaux movement, Calibre 59, which is based on the AS 5008 (later the La Joux-Perret 5900).
