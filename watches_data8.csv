                            Rolex has long been popular among women who know their horology. Unlike some brands that relegate ladies' watches to mere fashion statements, Rolex devotes just as much care and attention to its mechanical credentials as it does for watches aimed at men. The 'Lady' Oyster Perpetual participates in the same legendary history of Rolex's groundbreaking introduction of vital new technologies in the early 20th century, the Oyster case providing the first real water resistance, and the perpetual rotor allowing watches to run without manual winding. Slimmed-down in size to a 26mm case, this model with black dial and quarter Arabic numerals carries the same stunning elegance and attention to detail with which Rolex is synonymous.

                            The Speedmaster is one of the most iconic watches ever made by Omega, if not any brand. The company has done a strong trade in developing the watch's stratospheric reputation as the first and only timepiece worn on the Moon during the Apollo missions. Of the many special editions released, the all-ceramic “Dark Side of the Moon” was among the most memorable. This incredible version updates the Dark Side (originally inspired by the extraordinary Apollo 8 mission) with an edition called “Black Black”. The case, bezel and dial are all made of a deep black ceramic with black Super-LumiNova that creates even fewer contrasts than its predecessor. There's even a pitch black nylon strap.

                            It's the watch that originally made Rolex the industry-leading, super-desirable brand that it is today. First developed in the 1920s and 30s, the Oyster Perpetual combined the brand's groundbreaking waterproof case (Oyster) with its superb self-winding, in-house movement (Perpetual), creating an icon of watchmaking that would supply the foundation for legends like the Submariner. Today, the name is still used for many of its finest watches, but the true product survives in this stunning ref. 116000, new in 2014. Retaining the watch's flawless, classic design, evolved subtly for modern tastes, and its peerless mechanical prowess, this is a gorgeous timepiece for those who want something timeless.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            The Air King was named in honour of the brave RAF pilots of WWII, when Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, discovered they were ditching their standard issue watches for his Oyster Perpetual. As one of its longest continuously manufactured and most affordable watches, the Air King is a beloved staple of Rolex's range. At Baselworld 2016, the brand released this superbly updated model. It refreshes the classic look, upgrading size, durability and calibre precision while staying true to its aviation heritage in such key elements as the iconic 1950s Air-King font. Many believe that the dial design is inspired by the custom dashboard timepieces Rolex supplied to the Bloodhound SSC land speed record attempt.

                            The Yacht-Master, introduced by Rolex in 1992 in a gold case, was the first all-new watch from the brand since the Daytona in the 1960s. The watch was designed for adventurers and sportsmen—the topside equivalent to the diver's Submariner, to which it bears a strong similarity, though with more of a luxury than a tool watch feel. By 1999 it had become one of the most highly sought and desirable models in the Rolex stable after the introduction of a platinum version, though it wasn't until 2005 that the Rolesor reference 16623 arrived. Rolesor is the brand's term for two-tone watches that use both steel and gold, which this one does so in serious style. Like all Yacht-Masters, the bezel is made of a single block of solid gold.

                            Born as the amalgamation of incredible new technologies developed by Rolex, COMEX (the French deep-sea diving company) and the US Navy during the late 60s, the Sea-Dweller is Rolex's ultra-durable dive computer. In production for more than four decades, the 16600 model featured such pioneering technology as a helium escape valve and a 1,220m water resistance, and received a major upgrade in the form of the 116660 Deepsea model seen here. With a three-piece “Ringlock” case, “Triplock” crown system and 5mm sapphire crystal, this watch can survive pressures that would flatten a submarine. Its water resistance rating is an incredible 3,900m—deeper than the average depth of the ocean.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 448 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, authentic black dial and the blue hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.
