                            This magnificent pilot's timepiece from top Swiss brand IWC features a very special complication. The world timer is widely considered the cream of luxury travelling watches. Rather than simply adding an extra hand to show a second time zone, the watch features a somewhat more complex—yet intuitive and satisfying—operation. The time in the home city is shown by the primary hands on the dial, while the wearer can simultaneously see the time in every major city around the world by the position of the rotating 24-hour disk between the city names and the main dial (conveniently distinguishing between day and night). In this supremely well engineered and finished example, the cities themselves do not move, allowing the wearer to get used to looking for them always in the same place.

                            This gorgeous black Luminor is one of a limited run with reference PAM 508. The 508 is significant for being the first Luminor Submersible with a ceramic case, made from zirconium oxide with an added heat-resistant pigment that provides the deep black colouring. A sandblasted finishing creates the matt appearance. The result is incredibly hard, lightweight and scratch-resistant, and looks amazing in its imposing 47mm form. The black leather strap completes the look. The watch runs on the in-house P.9000 movement, which boasts a 3-day power reserve from two barrels, and allows the wearer to change the time in convenient 1-hour increments.

                            First held in 2009, the Lamborghini Blancpain Super Trofeo is a series of motor racing tournaments held around the world, in which amateur and pro-amateur drivers compete using Lamborghini Cup cars. The event is an exclusive showcase of the alliance between these two giants of the luxury industry, sharing their passion for superlative aesthetics and technology. Aiming to match the quality and style of the prestigious Gallardo cars created for the race, Blancpain unveiled this extra special Super Trofeo chronograph. Based on the brand's L-Evolution series, the watch is magnificently sporty and good looking without going over the top, and it houses an exceptionally sophisticated flyback movement.

                            The Speedmaster is so closely associated with NASA and the Moon landings these days that it's easy to forget that when it was first released in the 1950s, it was not remotely intended for space travel. Rather, as the name suggests, the Speedy was designed as a sports watch for timing motor racing and other fast, or indeed furious, events. Today it's very rare to encounter Speedies from the long lost pre-Moon era, but when you do find something like this gorgeous vintage piece from 1967, be sure to snap it up for your collection.

                            Known as one of the foremost purveyors of ultra-elegant jewellery, Cartier has long made superb watches, with excellent mechanical pedigree – but its principal strong suit has been high-fashion and style. The Calibre de Cartier collection represents a big step forward for the brand into the world of true haute horlogerie. Without losing an ounce of its customary sophistication and stylishness, the watches are equipped with the first self-winding movement entirely manufactured by Cartier SA: the glorious 1904 MC (named for the year that Louis Cartier famously made his first timepiece for Alberto Santos-Dumont). You can see it through the sapphire caseback.

                            In 2008, IWC announced a new collection of six vintage revivals, each from a different beloved watch series, to celebrate the 140th anniversary of the prestigious brand's founding in 1868. Each watch was designed and created based on the very first model from their respective family—in the case of this gorgeous Portuguese, this was the original piece from 1939 that began the extraordinary Portuguese legacy of ultra-elegant, high-precision chronometers. While it looks substantially different from today's models, this vintage reincarnation maintains the timeless, uncluttered beauty and sophistication that we still associate with the series.
