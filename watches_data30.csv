                            The modern Luminor design originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military-only contractor. Three limited edition pieces created at this time set the style for what would soon become modern Luminor. It somewhat modernised the 1940s-era look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the distinctive cushion case, and a crown guard to boost water resistance. This lovely example has an in-house movement, the P.3002, with a power reserve of three days that is displayed in a sophisticated retrograde indicator on the dial.

                            The brainchild of legendary watch designer Gerald Genta, the Nautilus was introduced in 1976 to compete with Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak, another now-iconic Genta-designed steel sports watch launched a few years earlier. Its case shape, with ear-like projections either side, was like nothing the industry had seen before and despite not being an immediate hit it’s now one of the most sought-after Patek models around. The 5990/1A, now discontinued, enhances an already remarkable watch with a host of extremely useful functions, comprising a second time zone—with a day and night indicator for both local and home zones—a date, displayed on the sub dial between 11 and 1 o’clock, subsidiary seconds and a flyback chronograph. Stainless steel, with a horizontally embossed black dial and white gold applied hour markers, it exudes high-end luxury and is powered by the automatic Caliber 28-520 S C FUS which holds a power reserve of 45 hours. The movement is visible through the case back, revealing the 21k gold rotor engraved with the brand’s Calatrava cross and decorated with côte de Genève stripes.

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. Reference 16550 is one of only three Explorer II variants since the first one, and also one of the rarest. It was in production for just one and a half or two years starting in 1985, and offered an improved, simpler look, new dial colours, GMT functionality and the first sapphire crystal in an Explorer.

                            When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the summit of Everest in 1953, their expedition team were supplied with watches by Rolex and the British company Smith’s. Rolex designed a watch specifically for the expedition, which came to be known as the Explorer, one of the less prominent models in the Rolex stable but one that has been a constant since its launch. A far plainer looking watch back then, the Explorer aesthetic is now characterised by the Mercedes hour hand, three-quarter numeral black dial and Oyster bracelet. This model, with a 36mm case, is the first to come in two-tone steel and yellow gold and runs on a Caliber 3230 which holds a power reserve of almost 70 hours.

                            Bremont describes the Supermarine collection as “divers watches inspired by our aviation principles”. This doesn't mean the Supermarine is a pilot's watch, but rather a traditional, good-looking and high-grade diver that is—at heart—a Bremont. Demonstrating the brand's no-nonsense British clarity and effortless sense of refinement, the Supermarine also boasts the impressive technical credentials for which Bremont, a relatively small independent brand, is rightly acclaimed. The watch uses Bremont's anti-shock mount, a Faraday cage and a helium escape valve to make itself seriously durable, with this limited edition further fortified by a DLC coating. Meanwhile, accuracy is guaranteed by the Swiss chronometer inside, lovingly embellished and assembled in Bremont's Henley factory.
