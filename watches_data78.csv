                            The Big Bang has long been prized for its bold, uncompromising designs and innovative use of new materials. Drawing on and expanding the porthole and fusion ideas of previous Hublot watches, the Big Bang was instantly hailed as outstanding when launched in 2005, and is now firmly established as one of the most iconic sports watches of the 21st century. The watches are known not just for their eye-catching, stylish designs, but also for their sense of fun and the fact that they are not afraid to move beyond aesthetics associated with “traditional” or historic watchmaking. This bright and delightfully skeletonised “Aero Bang” edition, limited to just 500 pieces, features a superb ceramic case.

                            The Big Bang has long been prized for its bold, uncompromising designs and innovative use of new materials. Drawing on and expanding the porthole and fusion ideas of previous Hublot watches, the Big Bang was instantly hailed as outstanding when launched in 2005, and is now firmly established as one of the most iconic sports watches of the 21st century. The watches are known not just for their eye-catching, stylish designs, but also for their sense of fun and the fact that they are not afraid to move beyond aesthetics associated with “traditional” or historic watchmaking. This stunning limited edition model boasts a sleek ceramic case and a striking dark design with vivid red highlights.

                            This is an especially rare and unusual complication from the ultra-prestigious and highly prized manufacture Arnold & Son, and in fact hails from the brand's most exclusive watch series, the Instrument collection. The DBG is a fascinating watch that is inspired by two historical masterpieces by John Roger Arnold, son of the legendary London watchmaker of the same name who, together with Breguet, invented watchmaking as we know it today.

The aim was to build a watch capable of showing two time zones simultaneously, with the ability to set quarter- or half-hour differences. This was a major technical problem for watchmakers, because the gearing in a movement does not allow completely independent adjustment. Arnold solved the issue by installing a second barrel, gear train and escapement, completely separate from the main movement. This is the same system used in this DBG, which has two symmetrically arranged mechanical halves, partially visible on the dial, as well as two main displays. The small subdial at 12 o'clock shows the two systems' equation of time.
