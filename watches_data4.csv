                            For a long time known as “just” Rolex's junior partner, the Tudor brand finally came into its own in 2010 with the exceptional Heritage collection. The company was originally created by Hans Wilsdorf in 1946 as a more affordable version of Rolex – watches built to the same quality standards but without the in-house movements. Capturing the glorious vintage essence of Tudor watches from yesteryear, but without any faux-vintage affectations, the recent Heritage models represent a perfect meeting of old and new. The Black Bay in particular draws on a wonderful synthesis of historic Tudor design cues, from the big crown to the snowflake hands and the rich brown and gold colour palette.

                            Part of Patek Philippe’s long-running Calatrava line, the Pilot Travel Time, released in 2015, nods to the aesthetic simplicity of the Calatrava while incorporating several practical features that take it way beyond its time-only dress watch origins. Set in a superb rose gold case, the mesmerising black-brown gradient dial is complemented by gold applied Arabic numerals with luminescent coating for excellent legibility in all conditions. The sub-dial at 6 o’clock displays the date, and a second hour hand—skeletonised—gives a second time zone, along with day and night indicators for each zone. It’s powered by the Caliber 324 S C FUS, an automatic movement with 18k gold rotor visible through the transparent caseback. This is a useful, elegant yet robust timepiece from this hallowed brand.
