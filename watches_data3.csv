                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. A variant on the regular 116710, this reference features gold elements in the bezel, crown, hands, indices and of course the bracelet.

                            This modern Rolex GMT Master II features a superb calibre 3186 (with parachrom hairspring and Breguet overcoil) and a gorgeous white gold case. But its most impressive asset is the classic-looking bezel, returning in the original blue and red. The GMT Master has long been known for its two-tone bezel, to differentiate day and night for pilots using the watch for long-distance flights, but this one is made of a single block of cerachrom, using a patented process that makes it one of the first watches to feature ceramic components in multiple colours.

                            This Rolex Daytona Cosmograph was designed to meet the needs of professional racing drivers upon its original release in 1963, with a reliable chronograph and bezel with tachymetric scale, allowing drivers to measure average speeds of up to 400 MPH. The name nods to Daytona, Florida—the home of a strong passion for speed and motor racing that emerged in the early 20th century. The relationship between Rolex and motor racing strengthened in 2013 when the watchmaker decided to enter the world of Formula 1, as Global Partner and Official Timepiece of the exhilarating sport. The 116520 introduced the in-house calibre 4130, a replacement to the Zenith-sourced 4030 in the previous 16520 and has become one of the most popular sports models ever created.

                            The legendary 5205 features several great complications, chief among which is surely the annual calendar. Patek revolutionised calendar complications when it invented the annual calendar in the 1990s, a complication with almost as much complexity and convenience as its perpetual counterpart, only needing to be set once per year. As in the equally well-known ref. 5960, the 5205's calendar is displayed via three small, instant-jumping and remarkably easy-to-read windows at the top of the watch. They nicely mirror a moonphase and 24-hour subdial combined at the bottom. With a concentric dial design, the watch takes on a wonderful, almost sporty appeal, while retaining every inch of the elegance for which Patek Philippe is so well loved.

                            It's rare for Rolex to create completely new watch collections, but this is what happened in 2012 with the exceptional Sky-Dweller. It's not just the design that's new – the watch also features a complication never seen in a Rolex watch before, the annual calendar. This difficult mechanical addition has been ever so subtly integrated. The main way you will even notice it is when the date magically jumps after months with only 30 days. There's a small indicator next to each hour marker; the black one shows the current month. This would all be remarkable in itself, but it's arguably overshadowed by the innovative new GMT display, occupying much of the central dial, and the even more innovative bezel. The latter has been upgraded with a “Ring Command” function that allows you to set the time and the other complications in a simple, intuitive fashion.

                            Invented in 1904, the Santos was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented for aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont to make it easier to check the time while flying. The watch was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, and to celebrate the origins of the timepiece, Cartier produced a wonderful series of Santos watches called the Santos 100. Modern Santos watches still maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numeral hour markers and fully incorporated lugs.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This recent model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting a cutting-edge movement, a magnificent gold case and bracelet, and high-tech cerachrom inserts in the bezel. The LN moniker stands for Lunette Noir—signifying that it uses an all-black bezel.

                            Calatrava watches, named after an order of ancient Spanish knights, are among the most elegant and distinguished in the world. They are known for their flawless, understated stylishness rooted in the finest Swiss traditions, combined with the avant-garde aesthetic in vogue at the time of the first Calatravas in the early 1930s. This version in yellow gold is as understated as they come and features an intricate hobnail-effect bezel within which the lacquered-finish white dial stands out. The elegant Roman numerals and simple stick hands in black—matching the crocodile leather strap— add to the timeless aesthetic and the automatic movement is housed in an especially slim case that makes it perfect for formal occasions.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 divers conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. In 2009, the design received a significant overhaul, leading to a new range of magnificent models like the very special, limited edition, black titanium watch for sale here, with its ceramic bezel, black lume, and striking, uncluttered dial. The black nylon strap is also an appreciated addition to the overall sleek, stealthy aesthetic. The piece maintains an excellent 300 meter water resistance, protecting the fine Swiss movement inside the Calibre 5.
