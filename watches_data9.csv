                            Partnering with one of the biggest American companies of the last century, Pan American Airways, Rolex created a watch that was capable of telling the time in more than one place or time zone—the GMT-Master. In 1983 the updated GMT-Master II was released, gaining the nickname “The Fat Lady” due to its chunky case. Later, in 2005, Rolex redesigned and rereleased the GMT-Master on its 50th anniversary by launching the GMT-Master II. This new release became the first Rolex sport watch with the new, larger case and ceramic bezel—famed for its scratch resistance and immunity to fading. Its updated 3186 calibre boasted some improvements compared to the older 3185, making the hour hand a lot easier to set. It also featured a new hairspring which was a lot less sensitive to temperature changes and magnetism—perfect for flying and travelling, just as the original intended. This special GMT-Master II—made of white gold—is the sequel to the watch that introduced the much-anticipated Pepsi ceramic bezel, now coming with a blue dial instead of white, for this second generation run.

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. The watch builds on the heritage of the legendary Explorer I, which has always been a firm favourite among enthusiasts—the watch was first established in the public mind after its pioneering ascent of Everest during the expedition of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Today the Explorer II deviates in some ways from the original look, but it continues to represent an exceptional, hardy, modernised tool watch with a top-of-the-range in-house movement and a design that does justice to its legacy in both sports and adventure.

                            This is a very special Sea-Dweller diving watch that represents several major firsts for Rolex. Released in honour of director James Cameron's headline-grabbing solo descent to the Challenger Deep at the bottom of the Marianas Trench, the watch has the highest water resistance rating of any piece made available to the public (3,900m)—although not as high as the concept watch Cameron took with him. Another first is the remarkable dial, which shifts like the ocean from blue to black. The green text matches the colour of Cameron's submarine, the 'Deepsea Challenger'. Finally, perhaps rarest of all, the watch was unveiled at a special press event in the summer of 2014. It's almost unheard of for the brand to launch anything outside of Baselworld.

                            Rolex has long been popular among women who know their horology. Unlike some brands that relegate ladies' watches to mere fashion statements, Rolex gives just as much care and attention to their mechanical credentials as it does for watches aimed at men. The Lady Datejust participates in the same legendary horological history of Rolex's groundbreaking introduction of the date window in 1945, and still bears the famous 'Superlative Chronometer Officially Certified' on the dial. Its slimmed-down size allows for stunning elegance and attention to detail, and its exceptionally attractive minimalism has ensured it remains a popular choice for sophisticated women.

                            The Yacht-Master was originally introduced by Rolex in 1992—the first all-new model from the brand since the Daytona in 1964. The watch was designed for adventurers and sportsmen, like the topside equivalent of the diver's Submariner, to which it bears certain similarities. This version updates the classic model with extraordinary mechanical upgrades. The chronograph mechanism has been tailored specifically to yachtsmen's needs, with a programmable 10-minute countdown feature for timing start sequences at regattas. The bezel, built with flawless ceramic inserts, is even more ingenious. Its bidirectional turning is linked to the movement, meaning you can use its simple and intuitive 'ring command system' to set the watch and its complications.

                            Having a date indicator on a watch is taken for granted these days, but before 1945, the concept didn't exist at all—until Rolex added a simple, yet game-changing element to their famous Oyster watch: the date window. This small aperture changed the role of wristwatches from mere timekeeping devices to calendars as well. The Datejust was (and is) known for its classic elegance—the watch is striking in its magnificent, minimalist beauty. This delightful 'mid-size' model, which comes in a variety of dial colours and materials, is intended for use by both men and women.
