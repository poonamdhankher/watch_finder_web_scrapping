                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history (this piece is inspired by its twin-engined Model 247 airliner from the 1930s). The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.

                            Tudor has stepped out of the shadow of its older sister brand Rolex in recent years, offering watches that feature some of the hallmarks of its more illustrious sibling but at a more accessible price point. It forged its distinct personality largely by delving into its archives and reviving old models, including the Pelagos, a version of a Tudor Submariner from the 1970s. This left-hand winder is powered by an MT5612 in-house calibre, which replaced the ETA movement of previous Pelagos models. It bears the now-iconic Tudor ‘snowflake’ hands, echoed in the square indexes, and the date is displayed in the window at 3 o’clock. The 42mm case is a blend of steel and titanium, while the bezel—also titanium—is coated in matt black ceramic. A handsome and versatile divers’ watch, it is water resistant to 500 metres, boasts a helium escape valve at 3 o’clock and holds a 70-hour power reserve.

                            The Autavia is one of TAG Heuer’s several iconic sports chronographs that includes the Carrera and, more famously, the Monaco. Produced between the 1960s and the 1980s, it was inspired by the period dashboard instruments of racing cars and worn by drivers including Jo Siffert. This version combines a three-register chronograph with a GMT function and also features a ‘Pepsi’ bezel which has retained its vivid blue and red colours in this particular example from circa 1971. TAG Heuer brought back the Autavia line in 2016 after a long hiatus so this original vintage model, made long before Heuer merged with TAG (Techniques d’Avant Garde),  is highly sought-after among collectors of the brand. The watch runs on a Valjoux 724 manual winding movement, which is based on the same movement that powered early Rolex chronographs. A vintage perforated strap completes the motor-racing aesthetic of this wonderful timepiece.

                            There’s a reason Audemars Piguet is a member of the so-called Holy Trinity of watchmakers and it’s not for its sporty Royal Oak model, exceptional as it is. This model—named after its co-founder, Edward Auguste Piguet—is a reminder of the brand’s mastery of elegant watches with high complications. Reminiscent of the company’s pre-Royal Oak era, this platinum-cased rectangular dress watch features a manual wind movement with tourbillon, visible through the large aperture at 6 o’clock, while above it is a rectangle filled with a mesmerising gulloche pattern and the Audemars Piguet name beneath 12 o’clock. Odd numbers are represented by baton indices and even numbers by Breguet-style Arabic numerals, both of which are applied. Boasting a beautifully finished movement visible through the caseback, this is an exceptional timepiece by one of the world’s greatest watch brands.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilot's watches. While the concept was successful and enjoyed various upgrades (including input from the legendary Gerald Genta), it was beginning to peter out in the early naughties. Seeking to refresh the collection, IWC partnered with Mercedes' high performance division, AMG, to create a series of cutting-edge timepieces that demonstrated both brands' commitment to the highest precision engineering. This model is made from zirconium-based ceramic, inspired by AMG's disc brakes, and houses the famous in-house Caliber 80110.
