                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. These watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, staying remarkably true to its historic legacy.

                            The Royal Oak Offshore raised eyebrows on its release in 1993 due to its hefty case size of 42mm. So much so it was quickly nicknamed ‘The Beast’. This 2010 release of the iconic Royal Oak Offshore is no exception, featuring a rugged, rose gold octagonal carbon fibre bezel. Audemars Piguet experimented with materials, opting for ones that are known for their high durability, relative lightness, and scratch-resistance: namely, forged carbon fibre and ceramic and a mix of carbon fibre on the case and lugs with a natural alligator leather strap—something more synonymous with fellow Swiss watchmaker Hublot. Boasting a tourbillion chronograph complication, visible through the skeletonised dial, this Royal Oak Offshore makes for an interesting piece within Audemars’ catalogue.

                            Long known as the “Moonwatch”, Omega's Speedmaster became an instant legend in the 1960s when it was chosen by NASA for official use in space, including the Gemini and Apollo programmes. But it was not originally designed for such a use. So in 1969, Omega produced a new, even more qualified watch—the Speedmaster MkII—for space missions. With a distinctive, tapered case, it came with either a regular black dial or the rarer “racing” dial. Unfortunately, the MkII was rejected by the astronauts for superstitious reasons and seemed destined to fade into the shadows of history until, happily, Omega re-released a modern version more recently. This watch, however, is the original model in all its vintage glory.

                            As part of a continuing commitment to help the admirable endeavours of UNESCO, IWC have created the Aquatimer Galapagos Edition, helping to raise awareness of the plight of the breathtaking islands that are home to an entirely unique ecosystem. Adorned in a black rubber coating, the stealthy watch is right at home on the black, volcanic Galapagos rock to which creatures have had to adapt in order to survive. A proportion of the proceeds from the sales of Galapagos edition watches have been donated to help maintain the environment of the islands.
