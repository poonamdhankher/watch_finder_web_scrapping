                            The El Primero legend is one of the great stories of 20th century watchmaking. Invented in 1969, it represented the end of an intense race between three major horological research teams to create the world's first automatic chronograph; a race that many believe it won. Today, the El Primero remains one of the most highly regarded movements in the world, and one of only a small number to use the stunning frequency of 5Hz for maximum precision. The marvellous timepiece for sale here allows you to keep an eye on this superb piece of horological history with a partially skeletonised dial that shows the escapement (and small seconds) in a cutaway at 10 o'clock. There's also a useful power reserve complication at 6 o'clock.

                            The Royal Oak is one of the most iconic watches in history – a product of the same genius designer, Gerald Genta, who was responsible for the likes of Patek Philippe's Nautilus and IWC's Ingenieur. The story is a dramatic one – Audemars Piguet had been lingering on the edge of collapse since the Great Depression, but the Royal Oak's unprecedentedly bold lines, steel case and luxury pricing turned Genta's creation into an enormous success that saved the prestigious company. Since then, the legendary watch has gone from strength to strength, and continues to serve as a key showcase for the best elements of the brand's historic and peerless watchmaking abilities.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they are among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79240, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            Panerai watches tend to follow certain conventions and design codes that make them instantly recognisable – but some watches move away from this formula, providing a welcome breath of fresh air. And few Panerai models have left the beaten track as much as the FER00003, the third watch from the brand's short-lived partnership with Ferrari. It's still got the distinctive cushion case shape, but other than that, there's little that says “Panerai” here – even the crown guard has been removed. Despite this, the Ferrari watches are lovely timepieces in their own right, and they possess the enviable combination of being both rare and relatively affordable. Indeed, unlike the first two Ferrari watches, this is a strictly limited edition.
