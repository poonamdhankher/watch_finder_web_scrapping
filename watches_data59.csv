                            Montblanc's watchmaking career took off in 1997, after a long history of making the finest quality pens and having already been absorbed into the Richemont Group along with the likes of IWC and Jaeger-LeCoultre. But the brand didn't get serious attention from the watch community until its acquisition of the historic and prestigious Minerva manufacture, which allowed it to create its own in-house movements and step fully into the limelight. The new 1858 collection, of which this is a stunning limited edition example, was conceived to celebrate Minvera's long history, with a design that beautifully captures the style of its 1930s inspiration.

                            Bell & Ross has long been passionate about military watches—unsurprising given its perpetual focus on bringing function and utility to the forefront of luxury watchmaking. Most of the brand's true military styles have been reserved for the Vintage collection, but some of the best pieces to receive its coveted “Military Type” label can in fact be found in the instrument series (BR01 and BR03), which was originally based on aircraft cockpit instruments. Bell & Ross state that these pieces pay tribute to the first professionals, historically, who relied on wristwatches. They display an authentic military awareness of a need for extreme legibility, both at day and night, as well as serious durability and precision.

                            Inspired by the men’s suit of the same name, this Longines Heritage Classic Tuxedo Chronograph pays tribute to the carefree nature of the late 1940s that came after the austerity of the Second World War. This piece, then, with its black and white concentric dial, embodies the sartorial style of that era, while remaining up to date with handy features such as the automatic calibre L895 and chronograph sub dials at 3 and 9 o’clock. The tachymeter scale is beautifully accented in blue, matching the hands of the small seconds and minutes registers, as well as the big seconds hand.  This Longines is an ideal watch for fans of vintage aesthetics but modern specs.

                            The U-2 is one of the most important high tech spy planes in the US Airforce. Nicknamed the Dragon Lady, early versions of the U-2 were in operation at the beginning of the Cold War, and continue to be flown by exceptional pilots based in Beale, California. Needless to say, this is the type of aviation history that Bremont adores. The U-2 collection is a sincerely heartfelt tribute to these amazing machines and the brave souls who fly them, often over 80,000 feet into the stratosphere for 12 hours or more at a time. The beautifully designed U-2 watches have, like the plane, been tested at even higher altitudes, as well as at temperature extremes of -40ºC or more, including tests “in the field” with the U-2 pilots themselves. The watch's ultra-durable Trip-Tick case contains an inner bezel operated by a crown at 4 o’clock.

                            Launched as part of the instrument series in the mid-00s, the Bell & Ross BR03 collection can be seen as the iconic BR01's smaller-cased brother. Like the bigger watch, the BR03 is all about utilitarian luxury, striving for extreme clarity, precision and reliability, designed for professionals as well as watch collectors. Its immediately recognisable square case and instrument-style appearance has put it at the centre of the brand's popularity, and the smaller size makes the BR03 more comfortable for many wearers. The Phantom version made waves as one of the first and most successful all-black luxury watches—the full effect of this incredible model has to be seen to be believed.
