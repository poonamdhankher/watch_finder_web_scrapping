                            Sleek, menacing and black as night, the PAM 438's dark allure is not the result of any external PVD or DLC. Dubbed the “Tuttonero” (from the Italian for All Black), it's a fully ceramic case, much harder than steel and amazingly durable, the result of an exceptionally long and high-tech process to achieve the gorgeous matte finish. The Tuttonero name is not an exaggeration—it's not just the case that's black. The entire strap is made from the same ceramic, and even the beautiful in-house P.9001 movement has undergone a blackening process to achieve a uniform look. It also has an impressive power reserve of three days and features a GMT complication.

                            The Royal Oak is one of the most iconic watches in history – a product of Gerald Genta, the same genius designer who was responsible for the likes of Patek Philippe's Nautilus and IWC's Ingenieur. The story is quite dramatic – Audemars Piguet had been lingering on the edge of collapse since the Depression, but the unprecedentedly bold lines, steel case and luxury pricing turned Genta's creation into an enormous success that saved the prestigious company. The Offshore collection, meanwhile, was designed by Emmanuel Gueit in 1993, and represents the next step in the evolution of the brand's signature creation. While sticking to the classic elements of the original Royal Oak, the Offshore takes its bold nature even further.

                            Created by Gerald Genta and like many of his famous watches, the Nautilus is a horological legend. Patek Philippe's most well known and desirable sports watch, it's celebrated for some of the best examples of emblematic Genta trademarks: large, angular bezel, comparatively thin case, integrated bracelet and bold, if straightforward, dial. The design is based on the traditional shape of portholes, up to and including the hinges often found on the sides—hence the Nautilus' unmistakable 'ears'. This model brings extra appeal in the form of a stunning movement with several additional complications: a small seconds, a power reserve indicator, and most impressively, a combined date and moonphase display.

                            Many Panerai watches were made in relatively small production runs, but it's much more rare to find models that are officially limited. The PAM 005 represents just such a limited edition, and at a comparatively reasonable price. The watch is a close cousin of the beloved 000 “Base”, featuring the same desirable logo dial and painted numerals, which many collectors prefer to the classic “sandwich” dials (like the PAM 111, another close relative of the 005). This is a beautiful Luminor Marina with superb luminova, an understated small seconds subdial, and a gorgeous, COSC-certified movement.

                            When Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the lunar module, codenamed ‘Eagle’, and onto the powdery surface of the moon, the Omega Speedmaster on his wrist became the legendary Moonwatch. Tested to the limits by NASA for the rigours of space flight, the Speedmaster had in fact been into space before the testing had even begun. In October 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra took his own personal Speedmaster on board Sigma 7 and orbited Earth a total of six times for the Mercury 7 mission. The Speedmaster continued to provide NASA astronauts with invaluable service for the Apollo 13 mission, when it was used to time the crucial burn that would return the astronauts safely to Earth.

                            Named after the speedway track in Florida that hosts a legendary, Rolex-sponsored twenty-four hour race, the Daytona is the quintessential driver’s watch and was given a boost in popularity when Hollywood icon Paul Newman wore an early version of it. The dial, with its three subdials, is clear and easy to read while a tachymeter on the bezel offers quick speed calculations. It’s powered by Rolex’s Caliber 4130 automatic chronograph movement which holds a power reserve of 72 hours. Introduced in 1963 it’s been in continuous production ever since, although this particular reference is discontinued. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit.

                            The Luminor design originated in the early 1950s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market—though it remained firmly rooted in the look and feel of the military watches of the '30s and '40s when the company was born. The new watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, with a clear and legible dial boasting stunning luminova indices and hands.

                            Tudor has stepped out of the shadow of its older sister brand Rolex in recent years, offering watches that feature some of the hallmarks of its more illustrious sibling but at a more accessible price point. It forged its distinct personality largely by delving into its archives and reviving old models, including the Pelagos, a version of a Tudor Submariner from the 1970s. This model is powered by an MT5612 in-house calibre, which replaced the ETA movement of previous Pelagos models. It bears the now-iconic Tudor ‘snowflake’ hands, echoed in the square indexes, and the date is displayed in the window at 3 o’clock. The 42mm case is a blend of steel and titanium, while the bezel—also titanium—is coated in matt black ceramic. A handsome and versatile divers’ watch, it is water resistant to 500 metres, boasts a helium escape valve at 9 o’clock and holds a 70-hour power reserve.
