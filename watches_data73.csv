                            You may have noticed the Hublot branding on Ferrari cars and drivers in recent years—this is of course the result of a powerful partnership that works two ways. Hublot has been creating extra special timepieces in honour of the legendary Italian carmaker, including its record-breaking “LaFerrari” watch that turned heads with a 50-day power reserve. This stunning Big Bang is only slightly less impressive. It's a visual treat, with the chequered carbon fibre bezel augmented by the strikingly skeletonised dial, tinted sapphire and Ferrari's stallion at 9 o'clock. The interior is no less amazing, boasting Hublot's groundbreaking in-house calibre, the UNICO, with tungsten rotor, flyback capability and three days of power.

                            Piaget was founded in 1874 and over the course of its history has earned a reputation as an accomplished manufacturer of ultra-thin movements, which they supplied to the likes of Rolex, Omega and Audemars Piguet for many years. Its elegant Altiplano line, which uses its very thinnest movements, includes what was once the world’s thinnest self-winding watch, the Ultimate 910P. That measured in at a wafer-like height of 4.3mm, while this Altiplano Skeleton model in a white gold 38mm case isn’t far behind at a super-slender 5.34mm. Its in-house calibre 1200S is stamped with the prestigious Geneva Seal and incorporates a platinum micro-rotor, visible through both sides of the case. The power reserve on this stunning dress watch is 44 hours.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            When Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the lunar module, codenamed ‘Eagle’, and onto the powdery surface of the moon, the Omega Speedmaster on his wrist became the legendary Moonwatch. Tested to the limits by NASA for the rigours of space flight, the Speedmaster had in fact been into space before the testing had even begun. In October 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra took his own personal Speedmaster on board Sigma 7 and orbited Earth a total of six times for the Mercury 7 mission. The Speedmaster continued to provide NASA astronauts with invaluable service for the Apollo 13 mission, when it was used to time the crucial burn that would return the astronauts safely to Earth.

                            This gorgeous Portuguese Automatic has many excellent qualities, but perhaps the most interesting is the movement's power reserve. It's not just the impressive length of stored power, but also the technical ingenuity employed to go above and beyond the call of duty. The watch is engineered to come to an automatic stop after seven days, despite the fact that the actual power reserve is more like eight days. Why? This avoids relying on the last part of the mainspring's stored power, which would entail diminished torque and potential problems with consistent accuracy. When coupled with the Portuguese's handsome appearance and prestigious history, this watch is a very enticing offer indeed.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history. The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.
