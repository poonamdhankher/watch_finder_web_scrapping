Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its attractive modern design and ceramic bezel. The watch uses Heuer's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features an evolved version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

                            Introduced in 2013, the Blackbird is a seriously good looking update for Breitling's Avenger series, and a welcome new member of the brand's growing compendium of awesome “stealth” (black-on-black) pieces. The watch may be a reference to the equally cool, black and stealthy SR-71 Blackbird – a legendary US Air Force reconnaissance plane that played a key part in the Cold War. With its carbon-treated titanium case and comparatively slim profile, this Blackbird is as ergonomic and lightweight as its namesake. The dial is super legible and glare-proof, while the movement is based on a premium Swiss chronometer.

                            The Chronospace uses Breitling's iconic digital-analogue display, pioneered in the early '80s when it played a major part in reviving the brand after the trials and tribulations of the quartz crisis. The design stays true to the company's legendary aviation heritage, with an imposing 48mm case that prioritises ruggedness and practicality—but doesn't neglect its stylish aesthetics. The watch features a memorable dial with oversize numerals at 3 and 9, and boasts a top-of-the-range, thermocompensated Superquartz movement with a host of functionalities. There's also the superb quality finishing and the consummate attention to detail that characterises all Breitling timepieces.

                            In both name and spirit, the Calibre 01 represents the first of what is expected to become a series of modernised upgrades for TAG Heuer timepieces masterminded by legend of the watchmaking world, Jean-Claude Biver. This model sees the familiar and iconic shape of the Carrera enhanced with an avant-garde (and larger) case build and a striking skeletonised dial. The 45mm titanium-carbide coated case is modular in design, constructed entirely in-house. The same goes for the movement (a modified version of the brand's superb Cal. 1887), which together with the skeletonisation and the red highlights creates a hi-tech aesthetic that builds on the watch's historical race car legacy.

                            Rolex has long been popular among women who know their horology. Unlike some brands that relegate ladies' watches to mere fashion statements, Rolex gives just as much care and attention to their mechanical credentials as it does for watches aimed at men. After all, the brand's founder, Hans Wilsdorf, launched his original, groundbreaking Oyster Perpetual on the neck of the legendary female swimmer Mercedes Gleitze on her record-breaking crossing of the English Channel. The Datejust introduced another world first in 1945 when it added a date window, and its slim, elegant and minimalist design has made it one of the top choices for sophisticated women ever since.
