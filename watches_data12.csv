                            Longines added a new dive model to its Heritage line with this 2014 release. Inspired by the brand’s diving watches of the 1970s, the Heritage Diver is a true homage to the watchmaker’s past, but with modern additions such as updated movements. This piece features a 43mm cushion-shaped case which adds to the retro aesthetic of the watch, as well as a date window at 6 o’clock and two chronograph sub dials at 3 and 9 o’clock—making this a useful timepiece indeed. The additional crown at 10 o’clock moves the inner bezel and the black dial flaunts a pop of colour thanks to the red markings and second hand. Powered by an automatic movement, this watch is perfect for fans of vintage watches, and one that’ll see you through land and sea with ease.

                            For a long time known as 'just' Rolex's younger sibling, the Tudor brand finally came into its own in 2010 with the exceptional Heritage collection. The company was originally created by Hans Wilsdorf in 1946 as a more affordable alternative to Rolex—watches built to the same quality standards but without the in-house movements. Capturing the glorious essence of Tudor watches from yesteryear, but without any faux-vintage affectations, the recent Heritage models represent a perfect meeting of old and new. The Black Bay in particular draws on a wonderful synthesis of historic Tudor design cues, from the big crown to the snowflake hands and the gorgeous burgundy bezel.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, and continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950’s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its lovely, paired-down tribute to vintage timepieces. The watch uses TAG's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features a modern version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

                            In both name and spirit, the Calibre 01 represents the first of what is expected to become a series of modernised upgrades for TAG Heuer timepieces masterminded by legend of the watchmaking world, Jean-Claude Biver. This model sees the familiar and iconic shape of the Carrera enhanced with an avant-garde (and larger) case build and a striking skeletonised dial. The 45mm titanium-carbide coated case is modular in design, constructed entirely in-house. The same goes for the movement (a modified version of the brand's superb Cal. 1887), which together with the skeletonisation and the red highlights creates a hi-tech aesthetic that builds on the watch's historical race car legacy.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, and continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its attractive modern design and ceramic bezel. The watch uses Heuer's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features an evolved version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

                            For a long time known as 'just' Rolex's younger sibling, the Tudor brand finally came into its own in 2010 with the exceptional Heritage collection. The company was originally created by Hans Wilsdorf in 1946 as a more affordable alternative to Rolex—watches built to the same quality standards but without the in-house movements. Capturing the glorious essence of Tudor watches from yesteryear, but without any faux-vintage affectations, the recent Heritage models represent a perfect meeting of old and new. The Black Bay in particular draws on a wonderful synthesis of historic Tudor design cues, from the big crown to the snowflake hands and the gorgeous burgundy bezel.
