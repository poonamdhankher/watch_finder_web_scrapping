                            Partnering with one of the biggest American companies of the last century, Pan American Airways, Rolex created a watch that was capable of telling the time in more than one place or time zone—the GMT-Master. In 1983 the updated GMT-Master II was released, gaining the nickname “The Fat Lady” due to its chunky case. Later, in 2005, Rolex redesigned and rereleased the GMT-Master on its 50th anniversary by launching the GMT-Master II. This new release became the first Rolex sport watch with the new, larger case and ceramic bezel—famed for its scratch resistance and immunity to fading. Its updated 3186 calibre boasted some improvements compared to the older 3185, making the hour hand a lot easier to set. It also featured a new hairspring which was a lot less sensitive to temperature changes and magnetism—perfect for flying and travelling, just as the original intended. This special GMT-Master II—made of white gold—is the sequel to the watch that introduced the much-anticipated Pepsi ceramic bezel, now coming with a blue dial instead of white, for this second generation run.

                            This technically superlative Ingenieur from IWC features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph, one of the most difficult and challenging mechanical complications in high-end watchmaking. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden behind the other; an extra pusher at 10 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other seconds hand continues to run. As well as being mechanically impressive, this Double Chrono is also an imposing wear, with a large titanium case and bezel, five ceramic screws and a rubber-coated crown and pushers—all materials inspired by IWC's partnership with the Mercedes Formula One team.

                            Expanding on their hugely admired Heritage Black Bay series, Tudor released its Black Bay Fifty-Eight in 2018, inspired by the brand’s reference 7924 Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1958—hence the name. Previously released Black Bays, still in production, had bigger cases—41mm, or even 43mm for the bronze model—but at 39mm the Black Bay Fifty-Eight is noticeably smaller and will suit those with a smaller wrist. A classic steel dive watch with a retro feel, including the faux-aged lume and distinctive red triangle on the aluminium bezel, this is a COSC-certified chronometer with 200m water resistance and an in-house movement—unlike the earliest Black Bays. Increasingly sought-after, this is a future classic that has further enhanced Tudor’s reputation and allowed it to step out of the shadow of its older sibling, Rolex.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 448 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, authentic black dial and the blue hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            Tudor has stepped out of the shadow of its older sister brand Rolex in recent years, offering watches that feature some of the hallmarks of its more illustrious sibling but at a more accessible price point. It forged its distinct personality largely by delving into its archives and reviving old models, including the Pelagos, a version of a Tudor Submariner from the 1970s. This left-hand winder is powered by an MT5612 in-house calibre, which replaced the ETA movement of previous Pelagos models. It bears the now-iconic Tudor ‘snowflake’ hands, echoed in the square indexes, and the date is displayed in the window at 3 o’clock. The 42mm case is a blend of steel and titanium, while the bezel—also titanium—is coated in matt black ceramic. A handsome and versatile divers’ watch, it is water resistant to 500 metres, boasts a helium escape valve at 3 o’clock and holds a 70-hour power reserve.

                            While this “Deep Two” watch is not the first IWC to feature a mechanical depth gauge—one of the most extraordinary complications you can find in a dive watch—it represents an evolution of the brand's previous model. The second generation of this super-practical diving family, the Deep Two can measure your current depth (up to 50 meters) as well as your max depth on a particular dive. The intuitive display functions more or less as a complete dive computer that can be used for any underwater calculations a diver needs to make. With excellent water- and shock-resistance, this is the ultimate tool for serious divers and horological enthusiasts alike.

                            The brainchild of legendary watch designer Gerald Genta, the Nautilus was introduced in 1976 to compete with Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak, another now-iconic Genta-designed steel sports watch launched a few years earlier. Its case shape, with ear-like projections either side, was like nothing the industry had seen before and despite not being an immediate hit it’s now one of the most sought-after Patek models around, particularly the 5711 model which was discontinued in 2021. This version in 18ct rose gold features the signature horizontally embossed dial in a rich chocolate brown with rose gold hands and applied hour markers. The date window at 3 o'clock  is also framed with a rose gold border. This magnificent piece is powered by the automatic Caliber 324 S C which holds a power reserve of up to 45 hours. The movement is visible through the caseback, revealing the 21k gold rotor engraved with the brand’s Calatrava cross and decorated with côte de Genève stripes. This is a truly outstanding timepiece from the world's most illustrious watchmaker.

                            Released in 1953, the same year as the Submariner, Blancpain’s Fifty Fathoms was the brand’s first ever dive watch and was the result of a request by Captain Bob Maloubier, a British secret agent during World War II who later became leader of the French military’s diving corps. He asked that the watch be as clear as that of a “guiding star for a shepherd” and Blancpain duly delivered with a dial that was highly legible. The first ever Fifty Fathoms, like the first Submariner, was water resistant to 100 metres, but modern versions can withstand 300 metres. This version in a large 45mm, hand-polished rose gold case features a flying, one-minute tourbillon—visible through an aperture in the dial—which also has a pointed arm that serves as a small-seconds hand. The power reserve is 168 hours and the amount of reserve is shown via the display above 6 o’clock. Through the exhibition caseback is displayed the Caliber 25A automatic movement with skeletonised rotor. This is an exceptional version of an iconic dive watch from Switzerland’s oldest watchmaker.
