                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history (this piece is inspired by its twin-engined Model 247 airliner from the 1930s). The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.

                            Celebrated Italian jeweller Bulgari has been making its own timepieces since 1980 but watches have always played an important role for the brand. Since it started developing its own calibres it has produced a number of impressively thin and complicated models, including tourbillons and minute repeaters, with many of these coming within the Octo range. This Octo model comes in rose gold and is paired with a fine alligator strap. The octagonal case—which has a distinctive layered design— harks back to the designs of Gerald Genta, whose brand Bulgari purchased in 2000. The skeletonised dauphine hands and baton markers are also rose gold, with Arabic numerals at 12 and 6 o’clock and a date aperture at 3 o’clock that’s small enough not to intrude on the delightfully clean dial. A transparent caseback reveals the BVL 193 automatic movement with 50-hour power reserve. There’s no better dress watch to pair with a tuxedo.
