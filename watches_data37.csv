                            Tudor has stepped out of the shadow of its older sister brand Rolex in recent years, offering watches that feature some of the hallmarks of its more illustrious sibling but at a more accessible price point. It forged its distinct personality largely by delving into its archives and reviving old models, including the Pelagos, a version of a Tudor Submariner from the 1970s. This model is powered by an MT5612 in-house calibre, which replaced the ETA movement of previous Pelagos models. It bears the now-iconic Tudor ‘snowflake’ hands, echoed in the square indexes, and the date is displayed in the window at 3 o’clock. The 42mm case is a blend of steel and titanium, while the bezel—also titanium—is coated in matt black ceramic. A handsome and versatile divers’ watch, it is water resistant to 500 metres, boasts a helium escape valve at 9 o’clock and holds a 70-hour power reserve.
