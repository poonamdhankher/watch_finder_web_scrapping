                            Breitling's legendary Aerospace watches were originally unveiled in the mid-1980s as part of the Navitimer collection, created as the next step in the evolution of the brand's cutting-edge instruments for pilots. With the most accurate, high-tech Swiss superquartz movements on the market, the Aerospace was rapidly adopted by professionals as the ideal multi-function tool watch—its robust and lightweight titanium case and advanced analogue-digital display were also decisive factors in its popularity. Today, Aerospace models remain favourites for collectors and professionals alike, and they continue to provide the outstanding accuracy, reliability and legibility that have long made them so highly prized.

                            The Transocean collection is one of Breitling's most sophisticated and elegant. Inspired by 1950s and 60s chronograph designs, it brings the brand's unmatched sports watch prowess to new audiences, powered by Breitling's remarkable chronograph movements. This limited edition Unitime Pilot features the company's superb world timer complication, first developed in the 1950s but now improved with in-house calibre B05 (based on the groundbreaking B01). The high-frequency automatic chronograph movement allows the wearer to shift time zones with incredible ease via the crown, which controls the cities, hour hands and 24-hour ring simultaneously.

                            In 1884, in a small town up in the Jura mountains called St. Imier, Léon Breitling opened a workshop that specialised in high-precision scientific measuring and timing equipment. So good were his creations that their popularity demanded that he relocated to a larger workshop, which he did in 1892. The new factory was on Montbrillant Street, La-Chaux-de-Fonds, and it remained there until 1979. Taking its name from this historic location where many watchmaking firsts occurred, the Breitling Montbrillant sources its visual inspiration from the aviator watches of the 1940s and 1950s that debuted the famous Breitling slide rule. This wonderful special edition, dubbed “100 years of aviation”, was made for the anniversary of the Wright brothers' landmark first flight in 1903.

                            The Rolex Explorer is one of the most highly valued and sough-after models in the world of vintage watch collecting. Originally based on the model worn by Tenzing Norgay in the first ever successful ascent of Everest in 1953, the famous ref 1016 Explorer was an evolution of two equally interesting preceding watches, the 6350 and 6610, and was manufactured from the late 60s to mid 80s. A versatile vintage timepiece that enjoyed numerous variations, the Explorer 1016 remains one of the best examples of Rolex's genius for combining sport and dress elements in their watches.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.
