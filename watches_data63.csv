                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilot's watches. While the concept was successful and enjoyed various upgrades (including input from the legendary Gerald Genta), it was beginning to peter out in the early naughties. Seeking to refresh the collection, IWC partnered with Mercedes' high performance division, AMG, to create a series of cutting-edge timepieces that demonstrated both brands' commitment to the highest precision engineering. This model is made from zirconium-based ceramic, inspired by AMG's disc brakes, and houses the famous in-house Caliber 80110.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, and continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950’s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage with its lovely, paired-down tribute to vintage timepieces. The watch uses TAG's famous 1887 movement, a smooth column-wheel chronograph that features a modern version of the remarkable oscillating pinion first patented by the brand in 1887.

                            Sleek, menacing and black as night, the PAM 441's dark allure is not the result of any external PVD or DLC. It's a fully ceramic case, much harder than steel and amazingly durable, the result of an exceptionally long and arduous process of diamond-wheel machining and microglass blasting to achieve the gorgeous matt finish. The material is too hard to mould and is originally created by extreme isostatic pressing of zirconium oxide followed by sintering at around 1,500°C. The beautiful in-house P.9000 movement has an impressive power reserve of three days and also features a GMT complication.

                            This gorgeous Portuguese Automatic has many excellent qualities, but perhaps the most interesting is the movement's power reserve. It's not just the impressive length of stored power, but also the technical ingenuity employed to go above and beyond the call of duty. The watch is engineered to come to an automatic stop after seven days, despite the fact that the actual power reserve is more like eight days. Why? This avoids relying on the last part of the mainspring's stored power, which would entail diminished torque and potential problems with consistent accuracy. When coupled with the Portuguese's handsome appearance and prestigious history, this watch is a very enticing offer indeed.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 diver conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its 300m water resistance, big date and chronograph functionality. Impressively, there's a tenth of a second counter at 6 o'clock, which is testament to the exceptional reliability and accuracy of the caliber inside.
