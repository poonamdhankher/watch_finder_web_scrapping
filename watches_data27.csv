                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade “superalloy” steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. The LN moniker stands for Lunette Noir—signifying that it uses an all-black bezel.

                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            The Ballon Bleu, one of Cartier's newest watch collections, has been hugely successful since its 2007 release. With a unique, curving, organic case, a cleverly integrated sapphire crown and a multi-facetted guilloché dial, the watch can rightly be called a gem in every sense, blending the best of classical elegance and futuristic originality. Creating beauty through simplicity, the watch showcases everything that makes Cartier such a prestigious and highly-sought brand. This model uses a superb Swiss automatic movement underneath the traditional Roman numerals and blue sword hands on the dial. It's a timepiece that has to been seen in the flesh to get the full effect.

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. The watch builds on the heritage of the legendary Explorer I, which has always been a firm favourite among enthusiasts—the watch was first established in the public mind after its pioneering ascent of Everest during the expedition of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Today the Explorer II deviates in some ways from the original look, but it continues to represent an exceptional, hardy, modernised tool watch with a top-of-the-range in-house movement and a design that does justice to its legacy in both sports and adventure.

Custom made for the skies and pilots this watch, first released at Baselworld in 2012, will see you soaring through the air in style with its crisp white dial and yellow gold fluted bezel and case and the black rubber bracelet. Inside, the 326238 features the calibre 9001, a superlative performer from Rolex that is one of its most complex in-house movements to date. Featuring the Sky-Dweller’s famed second time zone display on the dial, as well as an annual calendar with date and month display, this piece is as useful as it is stunning—making it perfect for jetsetters and those leading a busy lifestyle.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This white gold Daytona flaunts a stunning dial with a deep blue hue and white hour markers and branding, giving it an appealing understated look that oozes effortless cool.

                            The Omega Speedmaster has earned legendary status as the first watch to accompany NASA astronauts to the Moon. There are now countless variations of this timepiece but easily among the most collectible are the prized Snoopy limited editions. Presented by NASA to Omega in 1970, the Silver Snoopy Award was given to the brand for its contributions to “the success of human space flight missions”, while the reason it was named after the famous Peanuts cartoon-strip character was because of its role as an on-board mascot for the astronauts. This model celebrates the 45th anniversary of the award and features a Super-Luminova Snoopy himself on the seconds subdial at 9 o’clock, lying beneath a cartoon ‘thought bubble’ stating ‘Failure is not an option’ – a line from the film Apollo 13. The watch itself features the standard Speedmaster dial layout but in all white, with a black ceramic insert bezel and applique indices. This model, bearing a Snoopy engraving on the caseback, is limited to just 1,970 pieces and is powered by a manual calibre 1861 with 48-hour power reserve.

                            Originally designed in 1971 for the admittedly niche market of cave explorers, the Rolex Explorer II was later updated to fit the aesthetic codes of the brand's other sports watch families. The watch builds on the heritage of the legendary Explorer I, which has always been a firm favourite among enthusiasts—the watch was first established in the public mind after its pioneering ascent of Everest during the expedition of Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Today the Explorer II deviates in some ways from the original look, but it continues to represent an exceptional, hardy, modernised tool watch with a top-of-the-range in-house movement and a design that does justice to its legacy in both sports and adventure.

                            This masterful Radiomir from Panerai features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph (also known as a rattrapante), one of the most difficult and challenging mechanical complications in high-end watchmaking. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden; an extra pusher at 8 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other hand continues to run. The PAM 214 uses the OP XVIII movement, based on a stunning and unusual column wheel Valjoux.

                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. These watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, staying remarkably true to its historic legacy.
