                            The Cartier Tank has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design—inspired by the shape of a tank—that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            The Seamaster is one of the most iconic diving watches of all time. By the 1950s, it was among the most dependable and professionally sought dive watches from any brand, and it soon pioneered some of the sporty must-have features we associate with such watches, including unidirectional bezels, phosphorescent hands and the helium escape valve. The year 2005 saw the launch of a modern classic: the Seamaster Planet Ocean. This collection bursts with innovative style and energy, its design clearly rooted in Seamaster heritage yet daring to be original at the same time. The Planet Ocean's popularity only soared after being spotted on the wrist of Daniel Craig's James Bond in Casino Royale and its sequels.

                            From the world’s most revered historical watchmaker comes this exquisite and highly refined Grand Complications model, comprising a split-seconds chronograph, perpetual calendar and moonphase. Patek Philippe’s heritage in producing Grand Complications watches is unrivalled, with the brand famously making pocket watches for the renowned watch-collecting banker, Henry Graves, in the early 20th century. These days it puts its most intricate complications in its wristwatches, like this fine example in 18k rose gold. This being a perpetual calendar—with no need to adjust the watch for shorter months or leap years, at least until the year 2100—there is also a leap-year indicator, together with a day-night indicator. This extraordinary timepiece runs on Patek Philippe’s manually wound Caliber CHR 29 535 PS Q, visible through the sapphire caseback, enabling you to appreciate the movement’s spell-binding hand-finishing.

                            This is Omega’s first ever world timer model and one of just 87 pieces made, making it one of the brand’s most unusual and rare watches. Most notably, the dial's centre features a colourful hand-crafted enamel world map as viewed from the North Pole, which is surrounded by a 24-hour reference ring giving the time in a number of cities, from Athens to Auckland. The dart 12-hour indices and hands are 18k yellow gold and coated in Super-LumiNova and the 43mm case, unusually for an Omega, is platinum. There is also a discreet date window at 6 o’clock. It comes on a brown leather strap with a platinum-gold foldover clasp, while inside is Omega’s superbly finished Master Chronometer calibre 8939, a self-winding movement with co-axial escapement, which can be viewed through the exhibition caseback.

                            Describing its aesthetic as elegant, simple and creative, Vacheron Constantin has continually aimed to enhance and reinvent the art of fine watchmaking since its introduction over 265 years ago. The oldest Swiss watchmaker in continuous operation, it has cemented its place within the top three watchmakers in the world. This Patrimony Traditionnelle features a fourteen-day tourbillon, with a power reserve of about 336 hours—that’s two weeks—as well as Vacheron Constantin’s beautiful and prestigious in-house movement, the calibre 2260. As with all models from this watchmaker, it bears the Seal of Geneva—a sign of superior quality, craftmanship and reliability. The piece is also said to be perhaps the longest power reserve tourbillon-based watch with a single mainspring barrel—an impressive feat. The Patrimony Traditionnelle showcases Vacheron Constantin at its best, with a dial that combines modest features and an opening to a strikingly complex mechanism.

                            Named after Lake Geneva, the Blancpain Léman collection seeks to capture the evocative natural beauty of this iconic landmark, as well as its proximity to the heart of Swiss watchmaking heritage. With a strong grasp of traditional designs, the Léman watches are classic and authoritative, while simultaneously contemporary and refreshing. They speak to the timeless watchmaking legacy of the Blancpain company, which has been creating horological masterpieces since 1735. This stunning model is notable for its superb mechanical calibre (visible through the caseback), featuring a second timezone complication complete with a particularly wonderful day/night indicator.

                            First released in 1932, back when pocket watches were still popular and the preferred option over wristwatches, the Calatrava is one of Patek Philippe’s most loved watches. A huge influence on watch designs since its release, this Calatrava boasts ornamentation work that took over 30-hours of meticulous artistry from expert craftsmen—and that’s just on the dial. Today, the Calatrava has a healthy number of references to choose from and takes the wearer from day to night, and this limited edition 5088 model from 2015 is certainly a showstopper. It features a beautiful hand-engraved black enamel dial, created using the burin—or engraver—a tiny tool that acts as an extension of the craftsman’s hand and penetrates the material to create the desired pattern. The exquisite enamelling even extends to the sides of the white gold case. Inside the watch is an ultra-thin self-winding mechanical movement with the calibre 240, also visible through the case back. Limited to just 10 pieces worldwide, this Calatrava is the ultimate collector’s piece.
