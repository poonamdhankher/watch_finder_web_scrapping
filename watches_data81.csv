                            This special limited edition Panerai Luminor pays tribute to some of the brand's vintage early 20th century models when Panerai was making watches for the Italian and Egyptian Navies. At this time, certain rare models had the words “Marina Militare” and “8 giorni brevettato” (“8 days patented”), which have been replicated here. In addition, the 339 was the first watch to feature Panerai's special ceramic case material. It's called “composite” instead of ceramic to differentiate it from the ceramics of other watchmakers, which are typically made with a zirconium base. Panerai's is made by electrochemical processes using aluminium, making it harder and tougher than other ceramics, not to mention lighter than even titanium. The in-house P.2000/7 movement has an impressive power reserve of eight days, a nod to the original ""8 giorni brevettato"".

                            Released in 2014, the Hublot Classic Fusion Tourbillon Night-Out is described as Hublot’s evening watch. This Night-Out in particular is a glitzy showstopper, as opposed to the original more pared down Night-Out. It boasts a diamond paved dial and rose gold bezel set with even more diamonds and a tourbillon, visible at 6 o’clock, making for a striking design element which is also visible on the sapphire case back. A spin off from the original Classic Fusion introduced in 1980, with its port hole inspired bezel, the Night-Out adds some exciting features to Hublot’s more understated and minimalistic original Classic Fusion line.

                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            The first AMVOX was launched in 2004 by Jaeger-LeCoultre in partnership with legendary carmaker Aston Martin. While this brand's initials account for the first two letters of the AMVOX acronym, the “vox” part refers to JLC's iconic 1950s Memovox diving watch, which was known for its extraordinary alarm function. Created by design genius Francis Cretin, the watch was made with more than passing echoes of the glorious Memovox (especially the Polaris model), while simultaneously introducing ideas from Aston Martin dashboards. This superb, more recent limited edition is the fifth of the AMVOX models, and boasts a prestigious world timer complication.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.

                            This remarkable Audemars Piguet perpetual calendar in platinum was created to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the brand's reference 25548 model, which was released in 1978 and helped keep its tradition of haute horlogerie alive during the quartz era. Limited to just 90 pieces, it bears all the hallmarks of high-end Swiss watchmaking, with hand-finishing throughout, from the movement components to the noticeably thin case and its brushed steel sides. On the metallic blue sunburst dial are four registers that show both the triple calendar and leap year indicator, as well as the moon phase. Through the exhibition caseback you’ll find a spectacular winding rotor that is both skeletonised and hand-engraved while the bridges bear classic Geneva stripes. This is Audemars Piguet at its finest.
