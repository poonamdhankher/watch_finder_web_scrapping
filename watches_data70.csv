                            Breitling’s Navitimer pilot’s watch boasts the proud distinction of being the first Swiss wristwatch and chronograph in space, having been worn by NASA astronaut Scott Carpenter while orbiting the Earth in 1962 on the Mercury-Atlas 7 mission. Launched in 1952, it’s now one of the most recognisable watches around, with its three-register dial ringed with a tachymeter scale and circular aviation slide rule. This particular version in 18k rose gold is limited to 159 pieces and features specially tinted SuperLuminova coating on the hands and numerals to add to the vintage look. It’s powered by the in-house Caliber B09 which holds a power reserve of 70 hours.

                            In 1884, in a small town up in the Jura mountains called St. Imier, Léon Breitling opened a workshop that specialised in high-precision scientific measuring and timing equipment. So good were his creations that their popularity demanded he relocate to a larger workshop, which he did in 1892. The new factory was on Montbrillant Street, La-Chaux-de-Fonds, and it remained there until 1979. Taking its name from this historic location where many watchmaking firsts occurred, the Breitling Montbrillant sources its visual inspiration from the aviator watches of the 1940s and 1950s that debuted and featured the famous Breitling slide rule. The Datora model, with its additional calendar complications, is inspired by a particularly successful piece from this period.

                            Breitling's legendary Aerospace watches were originally unveiled in the mid-1980s as part of the Navitimer collection, created as the next step in the evolution of the brand's cutting-edge instruments for pilots. With the most accurate, high-tech Swiss superquartz movements on the market, the Aerospace was rapidly adopted by professionals as the ideal multi-function tool watch—its robust and lightweight titanium case and advanced analogue-digital display were also decisive factors in its popularity. Today, Aerospace models remain favourites for collectors and professionals alike, and they continue to provide the outstanding accuracy, reliability and legibility that have long made them so highly prized.
