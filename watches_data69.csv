                            Calatrava began as a medieval order of religious knights; their emblem was to be adopted many centuries later by perhaps Switzerland's most prestigious and revered watchmaker of all time, Patek Philippe, as the brand logo (here seen on the strap clasp). Its flagship Calatrava watches are among the most elegant and distinguished in the world, as exemplified by this stunning commemorative edition for the company's 175th anniversary. Limited to just 400 pieces, the watch houses an upgraded in-house CH 28-520 movement with a multi-scale chronograph capable of computing a range of calculations (including pulsometer, telemeter and tachymeter), with a sweep chronograph hand that doubles as conventional seconds.

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 424 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, rich brown hue and the gold hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.
