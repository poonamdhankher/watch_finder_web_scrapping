                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 divers conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its unidirectional bezel, exceptionally legible design and superb finishing and craftsmanship. The piece maintains an excellent 300 meter water resistance, protecting the TAG Heuer Calibre 5 inside.

                            The Ballon Bleu, one of Cartier's newest watch collections, has been hugely successful since its 2007 release. With a unique, curving, organic case, a cleverly integrated sapphire crown and a multi-facetted guilloché dial, the watch can rightly be called a gem in every sense, blending the best of classical elegance and futuristic originality. Creating beauty through simplicity, the watch showcases everything that makes Cartier such a prestigious and highly-sought brand. This model uses a superb Swiss automatic movement underneath the traditional Roman numerals and blue sword hands on the dial. It's a timepiece that has to been seen in the flesh to get the full effect.

                            The Yacht-Master was originally introduced by Rolex in 1992—the first all-new model from the brand since the Daytona in 1964. The watch was designed for adventurers and sportsmen, like the topside equivalent of the diver's Submariner, to which it bears certain similarities. This version updates the classic model with extraordinary new materials. The bezel is black ceramic, the case is glorious 'Everose' gold (a unique Rolex alloy), and perhaps most exciting of all, the strap is made of rubber—a major first for Rolex—that the brand is calling 'Oysterflex'. In fact, it's not natural rubber but a special material known as elastomer. Inside, you'll find the stunning calibre 3135.

                            It's rare for Rolex to create completely new watch collections, but this is what happened in 2012 with the exceptional Sky-Dweller. It's not just the design that's new—the watch also features a complication never seen in a Rolex watch before, the annual calendar. This difficult mechanical addition has been ever-so-subtly integrated. The main way you will even notice it is when the date magically jumps after months with only 30 days. There's also a small indicator next to each hour marker; the white one shows the current month. This would all be remarkable in itself, but it's arguably overshadowed by the innovative new GMT display, occupying much of the central dial, and the even more innovative bezel. The latter has been upgraded with a “Ring Command” function that allows you to set the time and the other complications in a simple, intuitive fashion.

                            For many, Patek Philippe will always be the ultimate brand of the dress watch. The ancient and incredibly prestigious firm may be best remembered for its haute horlogerie elegance, but one mustn't forget its equal mastery in the realm of sports watches. And we don't just mean the Nautilus, which has been the iconic go-to Patek for many decades. Many collectors have realised that its younger brother, the wonderful Aquanaut, fulfils most of the same sterling credentials at a lower price. This model, the brand's most recent, is a particularly fine example, and features the extraordinary in-house movement 324 SC.

                            Like many of its iconic watch families, Rolex's Milgauss was created in 1956 with a specific market in mind: scientists, power station workers and anyone else exposed to high magnetic fields. It was designed to be able to resist fields up to 1,000 gauss (hence the name—“mille” is Latin for thousand). The watch built a solid reputation with only two models until 1988, and was happily revived two decades later in a modern re-edition that remains faithful to the original purpose and aesthetics—including the beloved lightning bolt hand. This gorgeous GV version (Glace Verte) has a green-tinted dial crystal, and uses a Parachrom-Blu hairspring for even better magnetic and shock resistance.

                            This watch is not just a classic Submariner—one of the most popular and iconic watches in the world—but a striking and highly collectible variant edition. The watch is easily recognisable thanks to its rare green bezel and dial, causing collectors to give it the affectionate nickname “Hulk”, although LV itself stands for Lunette Vert (“Green Bezel”). This larger version updates the previous LV model ref 16610 (called “Kermit”) that was originally introduced in 2003 for the 50th anniversary of the Submariner. This edition boasts ceramic inserts in the bezel, with numerals in platinum.

                            This exceptional chronograph from the Master Compressor collection of Jaeger-LeCoultre, one of Switzerland's most prestigious and desirable watch brands, has many stand-out features. The energetic-yet-elegant, red, white and black design is immediately attention grabbing, and closer inspection only reveals yet greater marvels. The watch is fitted with one of the first examples of JLC's cutting-edge shock absorbing system, using an air cushion to protect the exquisitely engineered movement. Calibre 752 is one of the brand's first in-house automatic chronographs, and uses a vertical coupling system for extreme precision. This example is even more remarkable for its extra complications, including the stunning world timer, showing the time in all 24 zones simultaneously.
