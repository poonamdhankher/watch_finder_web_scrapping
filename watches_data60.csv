                            Launched as part of the instrument series in the mid-00s, the Bell & Ross BR03 collection can be seen as the iconic BR01's smaller-cased brother. Like the bigger watch, the BR03 is all about utilitarian luxury, striving for extreme clarity, precision and reliability, designed for professionals as well as watch collectors. Its immediately recognisable square case and instrument-style appearance has put it at the centre of the brand's popularity, and the smaller size makes the BR03 more comfortable for many wearers. The Phantom version made waves as one of the first and most successful all-black luxury watches—the full effect of this incredible model has to be seen to be believed.

                            The U-2 is one of the most important high tech spy planes in the US Airforce. Nicknamed the Dragon Lady, early versions of the U-2 were in operation at the beginning of the Cold War, and continue to be flown by exceptional pilots based in Beale, California. Needless to say, this is the type of aviation history that Bremont adores. The U-2 collection is a sincerely heartfelt tribute to these amazing machines and the brave souls who fly them, often over 80,000 feet into the stratosphere for 12 hours or more at a time. The beautifully designed U-2 watches have, like the plane, been tested at even higher altitudes, as well as at temperature extremes of -40ºC or more, including tests “in the field” with the U-2 pilots themselves. The watch's ultra-durable Trip-Tick case contains an inner bezel operated by a crown at 4 o’clock.
