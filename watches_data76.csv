                            This Panerai Radiomir is 1 of 1000 made and features a ‘tropical’ dial. 
The watch’s dial has been fashioned to resemble the patina seen on vintage Panerai watches which have suffered the effects of radioactive exposure. The Radiomir paint in the vintage watches emitted gamma rays, from the radioactive Radium, and aged the watch in a fashion which turned the originally black paint to a light brown colour. 
Brevetatto, the Italian for patented, is inscribed around the bezel and refers to the design of the watch which adheres to a vintage aesthetic, Panerai have used a 12-sided bezel like those found on prototype watches from the 1930’s.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilot's watches. Created by the legendary designer Gerald Genta in the 1970s, the watch was allegedly inspired by a diving helmet, giving Genta the relatively new idea of leaving the functional case elements like screws and bores exposed, instead of hiding them away. This modernist aesthetic was a huge success for IWC, and the Ingenieur has become a horological icon. The same principles are still evident in this stunning “Climate Action” limited edition made in support of The Climate Group, a non-profit campaigning for a low-carbon economy.

                            The U-2 is one of the most important high-tech spy planes in the US Airforce. Nicknamed the Dragon Lady, early versions of the U-2 were in operation at the beginning of the Cold War, and continue to be flown by exceptional pilots based in Beale, California. Needless to say, this is the type of aviation history that Bremont adores. The U-2 collection is a sincerely heartfelt tribute to these amazing machines and the brave souls who fly them, often over 80,000 feet into the stratosphere for 12 hours or more at a time. The beautifully designed U-2 watches have, like the plane, been tested at even higher altitudes, as well as at temperature extremes of -40ºC or more—including tests “in the field” with the U-2 pilots themselves. The watch's ultra-durable Trip-Tick case contains an inner bezel operated by a crown at 4 o'clock.

                            This exquisite Panerai gem is a masterclass in subtlety in fine watchmaking. At first glance, the watch seems not too dissimilar to other Luminor pieces, with its gorgeous vintage Italian aesthetic, beloved of so many collectors. But inside, the PAM 306 is powered by Panerai's in-house calibre P.2005, which boasts a magnificent 30-second tourbillon cage. Where other brands would have put the prestigious tourbillon on the dial, Panerai keeps it a subtle feature for true watch lovers to admire through the caseback—alongside the equally impressive six-day power reserve display. The watch is a titanium limited edition of just 150 pieces, and also features GMT and day/night indications, while the small dot in the 9 o'clock subdial shows the tourbillon's half-minute rotation.

                            First released in 2009, the original King Power is a sizeable watch at 48mm, making it a controversial piece that splits opinion, although it has attracted the attention of two incredibly famous sporting legends in Diego Maradona and Usain Bolt, elevating the watch’s appeal. This limited-edition King Power Tourbillon GMT is one of only 28 examples in existence, making it a perfect collector’s piece. With a hand-wound tourbillon GMT movement visible through the skeleton dial and a handy calendar in the 9 o’clock position, all sat within a porthole-shaped bezel, the King Power Tourbillon GMT Zirconium is a futuristic watch suitable for everyday wear.

                            From the brand that was founded by the Godfather of horology, Abraham-Louis Breguet, this remarkable model is a world-timer with a highly unusual instant jumping time-zone display covering 24 cities. The pusher at 8 o’clock is used to set the reference city, while the crown at 3 o’clock sets the time. Switching between two cities is simple, masking the complexity of the automatic movement within, which can be viewed through the transparent caseback. The watch also bears the hallmarks of this illustrious watchmaker, with classic Breguet Roman numerals and ‘pomme’ hands. The case is rose gold with an ornate fluted band and the dial is dominated by a map of the western hemisphere, with a day and night indicator between 3 o’clock and 4 o’clock. Windows at 12 and 6 o’clock reveal the date and the city to which the displayed time is set. This is one of the most luxurious travel watches around and a must for any serious Breguet collectors.

                            This rare and incredibly elegant perpetual calendar is a true technical marvel. It's not just the quantity of data it records, from the date (including a four-digit year display) to the moonphase (with separate indications for northern and southern hemispheres) and even the seriously impressive seven-day power reserve (indicated inside the 3 o'clock subdial). The most extraordinary part of the watch is in fact the humble—yet sophisticated—crown. Based on the original design by the legendary watchmaker Kurt Klaus, the entire watch is set by the single crown; all components are connected so that you don't have to redo each little display one by one.

                            IWC's Top Gun series stands as a tribute to the elite pilot's training centre for the US Marines in Miramar, California, immortalised by the iconic 1986 Tom Cruise motion picture. The design is built to recall the deck watches of the 1930s and 1940s, referencing IWC's history in pilot's watches.  This impressive watch also features an elaborate Top Gun engraving, stunning anthracite dial and an extra lightweight ceramic and titanium case made with zirconium oxide fired at temperatures approaching 2,000 degrees centigrade. The in-house calibre 51111 has a seven day power reserve, and the watch comes with a military style green textile strap.

                            IWC's Da Vinci collection pays homage to one of the most inventive thinkers of history, the Renaissance Italian genius who was actually one of Europe's earliest mechanical horologists. A number of da Vinci's inventions, while unable to be built during his lifetime, have since been incorporated into mechanical watches. IWC's first Da Vinci timepiece, from the 1960s, showcased some of the most advanced quartz technology ever made at the time. The collection was revived in the 1980s, this time featuring a spectacular mechanical movement with a perpetual calendar designed by the legendary Kurt Klaus. Since then, Da Vinci watches have achieved more world firsts and turned many heads. This beautiful, platinum, retro-flavoured “vintage” edition was inspired by one of the earliest models.
