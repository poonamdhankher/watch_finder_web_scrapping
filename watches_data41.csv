                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 46mm sports watch with a silver, black and yellow colour scheme inspired by the brand's work in the Galapagos Islands.

                            Originating in Florence, Tuscany, Panerai has a long history of making stylish and extremely reliable watches for professional divers, beginning with its famed WWII contract for the Italian Navy's “Frogmen”. The PAM Submersible pieces are among Panerai's finest diving tools. This superb example features a super-tough black carbon fibre (‘Carbotech’) case and bezel with graduated scale. The watch runs on the in-house P.9000 movement, which boasts a 3-day power reserve from two barrels and allows the wearer to change the time in convenient 1-hour increments. The matching black factory strap is made of a durable rubber that is perfect for diving.

                            While this watch shares many of the beloved characteristics associated with the Panerai Radiomir—big cushion case; vintage, legible design; sandwich dial; onion crown; leather strap—it is strikingly different in its immediate impact on the viewer. Sleek, menacing and black as night, the PAM 292's dark allure is not the result of any external PVD or DLC. It's a fully ceramic case, much harder than steel and amazingly durable, the result of an exceptionally long and arduous process of diamond-wheel machining and microglass blasting. The material is too hard to mould and is originally created by extreme isostatic pressing of zirconium oxide followed by sintering at around 1,500°C.
