                            IWC's Da Vinci collection pays homage to one of the most inventive thinkers of history, the Renaissance Italian genius who was actually one of Europe's earliest mechanical horologists. A number of da Vinci's inventions, while unable to be built during his lifetime, have since been incorporated into mechanical watches. IWC's first Da Vinci timepiece, from the 1960s, showcased some of the most advanced quartz technology ever made at the time. The collection was revived in the 1980s, this time featuring a spectacular mechanical movement with a perpetual calendar designed by the legendary Kurt Klaus. Since then, Da Vinci watches have achieved more world firsts and turned many heads. This beautiful, platinum, retro-flavoured “vintage” edition was inspired by one of the earliest models.

                            The Royal Oak Offshore, released in 1993, certainly raised eyebrows due to its hefty case size of 42mm, so much so it was quickly nicknamed ‘The Beast’. This special-edition 2007 release of the Alinghi Royal Oak Offshore is limited to 2,007 pieces. Made of platinum and forged carbon, it makes for an interesting redesign of the original Offshore and was created to celebrate the Alinghi sailing team’s victory, after which Audemars Piguet invited representatives of the international press to Valencia to unveil its exciting new creation. Developed with brilliant shock and water resistance and featuring a flyback chronograph function as well as a 10-minute countdown, this timepiece is purpose-built to keep in with the 11-minute race start rule. The dial perfectly echoes the nautical world, with counter hands shaped like the prow of a ship and the Alinghi logo at 3 o’clock. This timepiece is perfect for collectors and fans of watches and sailing alike.

                            Before the legendary Calibre 360, which made headlines as the first mechanical chronograph movement capable of measuring hundredths of a second, there was the Calibre 36. Equally legendary, in its way, the 36 can count tenths of a second thanks to its super-high frequency of 5Hz (most high-end chronographs beat at 4Hz). This might remind you of another famous chronograph movement, and you'd be right: the Calibre 36 is a modified version of Zenith's El Primero—ironic, considering Heuer and Zenith were competitors in the famous 1969 race to build the first automatic chrono—although this one has been upgraded with additional flyback capability. This gorgeous, cutting-edge Carrera evolves the remarkable Mikrograph design with a silver ring encompassing a gloriously brushed anthracite centre.

                            Part of the Portugieser family—one of IWC’s flagship models originally released in 1939—the IWC Portuguese Tourbillon Mystere 5042 was later released between 2008 and 2009. This piece features an automatic movement beating at a frequency of 19800 bph, which provides a 168-hour power reserve once fully wound. With a tourbillon escapement at 12 o’clock, and a date display in a stylish arc that reaches from the three to the six on a 31-day indicator, this special limited-edition Portuguese features a white gold case with an ardoise-coloured dial. With only 500 pieces ever made, it is a rarity, perfect for collectors.

                            Patek Philippe’s Grand Complications collection prides itself on displaying the brand's expertise in all horological complications. This includes tourbillons, grande and petite sonnerie striking mechanisms, minute repeaters, perpetual calendars (this takes account of monthly variations, including those in leap years), moon phases, and split-second chronographs. Patek have even managed to build the world’s most complicated portable timepiece this century on two separate occasions. The 5940 was introduced at Basel World 2012, and originally featured a yellow gold cushion-shaped case. Its self-winding calibre 240 Q movement displays the day, date, month, leap year and 24-hour indication by hands. In 2017 the reference 5940R-001 was added to the collection, featuring an updated rose gold case.

                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilot's watches. Created by the legendary designer Gerald Genta in the 1970s, the watch was allegedly inspired by a diving helmet, giving Genta the relatively new idea of leaving the functional case elements like screws and bores exposed, instead of hiding them away. This modernist aesthetic was a huge success for IWC, and the Ingenieur has become a horological icon. The same principles are still evident in this stunning “Climate Action” limited edition made in support of The Climate Group, a non-profit campaigning for a low-carbon economy.

                            Before the legendary Calibre 360, which made headlines as the first mechanical chronograph movement capable of measuring hundredths of a second, there was the Calibre 36. Equally legendary, in its way, the 36 can count tenths of a second thanks to its super-high frequency of 5Hz (most high-end chronographs beat at 4Hz). This might remind you of another famous chronograph movement, and you'd be right: the Calibre 36 is a modified version of Zenith's El Primero—ironic, considering Heuer and Zenith were competitors in the famous 1969 race to build the first automatic chrono—although this one has been upgraded with additional flyback capability. This gorgeous, cutting-edge Carrera evolves the remarkable Mikrograph design with a silver ring encompassing a gloriously brushed anthracite centre.
