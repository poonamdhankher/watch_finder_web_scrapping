                            Inspired by the men’s suit of the same name, this Longines Heritage Classic Tuxedo Chronograph pays tribute to the carefree nature of the late 1940s that came after the austerity of the Second World War. This piece, then, with its black and white concentric dial, embodies the sartorial style of that era, while remaining up to date with handy features such as the automatic calibre L895 and chronograph sub dials at 3 and 9 o’clock. The tachymeter scale is beautifully accented in blue, matching the hands of the small seconds and minutes registers, as well as the big seconds hand.  This Longines is an ideal watch for fans of vintage aesthetics but modern specs.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 diver conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its 300m water resistance, big date and chronograph functionality. Impressively, there's a tenth of a second counter at 6 o'clock, which is testament to the exceptional reliability and accuracy of the caliber inside.

                            Expanding on their hugely admired Heritage Black Bay series, Tudor released its Black Bay Fifty-Eight in 2018, inspired by the brand’s reference 7924 Oyster Prince Submariner, released in 1958—hence the name. Previously released Black Bays, still in production, had bigger cases—41mm, or even 43mm for the bronze model—but at 39mm the Black Bay Fifty-Eight is noticeably smaller and will suit those with a smaller wrist. A classic steel dive watch with a retro feel, including the faux-aged lume and distinctive red triangle on the aluminium bezel, this is a COSC-certified chronometer with 200m water resistance and an in-house movement—unlike the earliest Black Bays. Increasingly sought-after, this is a future classic that has further enhanced Tudor’s reputation and allowed it to step out of the shadow of its older sibling, Rolex.
