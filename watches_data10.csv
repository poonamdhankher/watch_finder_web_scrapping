                            The brainchild of legendary watch designer Gerald Genta, the Nautilus was introduced in 1976 to compete with Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak, another now-iconic Genta-designed steel sports watch launched a few years earlier. Its case shape, with ear-like projections either side, was like nothing the industry had seen before and despite not being an immediate hit it’s now one of the most sought-after Patek models around. Notably, this all-steel reference 5980 model from 2008 features a single, concentrically designed sub-dial at 6 o’clock to display its chronograph functions, while a small aperture at 3 o’clock displays the date, discreetly set amongst the signature horizontal ridges of the stunning blue-grey dial. Through the transparent caseback, the gold rotor of the automatic Caliber CH 28-520 movement can be viewed. This is a highly sought-after timepiece, now discontinued, from arguably the world’s most illustrious watch brand.

                            Patek Philippe, one of the most prestigious watch firms in all of Switzerland, has a sparkling history when it comes to timepieces for ladies. For at leat 150 years, its jewellery watches have been the best of the best, and the acclaimed Twenty-4 collection is no exception. Launched in 1999, it is inspired by, and in many ways represents an evolution of, the brand's famed Gondolo watches, and draws on the timeless Art Deco style that Patek Philippe does so well. This gorgeous rectangular model features a consummately elegant, minimalist design with diamonds in two rows (on the case and as indices on the dial) framing single Roman numerals at 6 and 12. At once classic, refined and dazzling, this is a phenomenal piece of horology is not to be missed.

                            It was in 1904 that Louis Cartier gave a watch to his good friend and aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont that was designed to be worn on the wrist. The Santos watch was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented to make it easier to check the time while flying. It was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, as well as a very early example of the iconic Art Deco style that would influence fashion and watchmaking for decades. The modern Santos watches maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numerals and fully incorporated lugs—as well as the stunning guilloché dial on this model.
