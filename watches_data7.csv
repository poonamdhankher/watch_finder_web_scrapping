                            This is a special limited edition Speedmaster made by Omega to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11. The first time humans landed on the moon, this was also the occasion on which the Speedmaster officially became the legendary Moonwatch, as Buzz Aldrin wore one during the inaugural moonwalk (Neil Armstrong left his onboard as a backup for a malfunctioning computer). This limited edition features the famous Apollo 11 “eagle” mission patch on the small seconds subdial and engraved on the caseback, and also has an extra line of text on the dial that remembers the exact time that Armstrong made his “one small step”.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet, not to mention the subtle and effective use of gold in this reference.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with high-quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This superb addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage, adding a particularly elegant, wearable model with a pared-down design that cuts to the best of what Heuer can provide.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade “superalloy” steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. The LN moniker stands for Lunette Noir—signifying that it uses an all-black bezel.

The Santos watch was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented to make it easier to check the time while flying. It was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, as well as a very early example of the iconic Art Deco style that would influence fashion and watchmaking for decades. The modern Santos watches maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numerals and fully incorporated lugs.
