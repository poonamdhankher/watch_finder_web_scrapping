                            Sleek, menacing and black as night, the PAM 441's dark allure is not the result of any external PVD or DLC. It's a fully ceramic case, much harder than steel and amazingly durable, the result of an exceptionally long and arduous process of diamond-wheel machining and microglass blasting to achieve the gorgeous matt finish. The material is too hard to mould and is originally created by extreme isostatic pressing of zirconium oxide followed by sintering at around 1,500°C. The beautiful in-house P.9000 movement has an impressive power reserve of three days and also features a GMT complication.

                            Although best known for its Reverso collection, Jaeger-LeCoultre is one of a handful of Swiss bands consistently producing watches with high-prestige complications, such as tourbillons and perpetual calendars. This particular model is one of the highlights of its Master series, a stunning, open-face minute repeater in 18k rose gold with both power reserve and torque indicators on the left and right of the dial, respectively. Unusual for minute repeaters, which rely on a ‘closed’ watch to help amplify the sounds of the gongs, this is an open-face dial, allowing a rare view of this enchanting mechanism, which innovates by having the chiming gongs fused to the crystal. Limited to just 175 pieces, this discontinued watch, a hand-winder with sapphire caseback, is an exceptional piece and justifies JLC’s status as the ‘Watchmaker’s watchmaker’.

                            Designed by Emmanuelle Gueit to celebrate twenty years since the 1972 release of its now-iconic older brother, the Royal Oak, the Offshore range is said to have influenced the trend for oversized watches that began in the mid 1990s. Despite being very similar to its forebear, designed by Gerald Genta, the Royal Oak Offshore is bigger and bolder, often paired with tough rubber straps. This particular limited edition chronograph model comes in 18k rose gold, with rose gold Arabic numerals and hands on the brown dial which lies within a hefty 48mm case. Besides the three chronograph registers there is a date aperture at 3 o’clock and water resistance is 100 metres. The watch, which comes on a pin-buckle rubber strap, runs on the brand’s in-house self-winding Caliber 3126/3840 which has a power reserve of 55-60 hours. Just 350 pieces of this watch were made.

                            The brainchild of legendary watch designer Gerald Genta, the Nautilus was introduced in 1976 to compete with Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak, another now-iconic Genta-designed steel sports watch launched a few years earlier. Its case shape, with ear-like projections either side, was like nothing the industry had seen before and despite not being an immediate hit it’s now one of the most sought-after Patek models around, particularly the 5711 model which was discontinued in 2021. This version in 18ct rose gold features the signature horizontally embossed dial in a rich chocolate brown with rose gold hands and applied hour markers. The date window at 3 o'clock  is also framed with a rose gold border. This magnificent piece is powered by the automatic Caliber 324 S C which holds a power reserve of up to 45 hours. The movement is visible through the caseback, revealing the 21k gold rotor engraved with the brand’s Calatrava cross and decorated with côte de Genève stripes. This is a truly outstanding timepiece from the world's most illustrious watchmaker.

                            If you're a big fan of Panerai, the legendary Italian watchmaker, chances are you've encountered Paneristi.com, the “unofficial resource” and forum where collectors and enthusiasts meet and discuss everything Panerai-related. In a spectacular gesture of good will towards its loyal supporters, the brand itself agreed to create a very limited run of watches in collaboration with the Paneristi site moderators themselves. PVD case, painted patina dial, OP logo, and even a special caseback inscription that commemorates the forum's 10th anniversary—this is the ultimate Panerai for collectors. Competition to own one couldn't have been more fierce.

                            Named after the speedway track in Florida that hosts a legendary, Rolex-sponsored twenty-four hour race, the Daytona is the quintessential driver’s watch and was given a boost in popularity when Hollywood icon Paul Newman wore an early version of it. The dial, with its three subdials, is clear and easy to read while a tachymeter on the bezel offers quick speed calculations. It’s powered by Rolex’s Caliber 4130 automatic chronograph movement which holds a power reserve of 72 hours. Introduced in 1963 it’s been in continuous production ever since, although this particular reference is discontinued. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors.

                            Many Panerai watches were made in relatively small production runs, but it's much more rare to find models that are officially limited. The PAM 005 represents just such a limited edition, and at a comparatively reasonable price. The watch is a close cousin of the beloved 000 “Base”, featuring the same desirable logo dial and painted numerals, which many collectors prefer to the classic “sandwich” dials (like the PAM 111, another close relative of the 005). This is a beautiful Luminor Marina with superb luminova, an understated small seconds subdial, and a gorgeous, COSC-certified movement.
