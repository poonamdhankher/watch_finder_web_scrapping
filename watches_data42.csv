                            The Radiomir collection is named after the distinctive luminescent compound Panerai developed when it sold watches to the Italian Navy in the 1930s. Today it is known for several beloved characteristics that have made it an icon of horology—big cushion case; vintage, legible design; sandwich dial; onion crown; and leather strap. Here we have a gorgeous 47mm limited edition in polished pink gold that positively gleams on the wrist. Known as the Ora Rosa, this version features a superb, paired-down dial. The transparent caseback allows the owner to examine the stunning in-house movement P.3000, which boasts two barrels and three days of power.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilots' watches. Created by the legendary designer Gerald Genta in the 1970s, the watch was allegedly inspired by a diving helmet, giving Genta the relatively new idea of leaving the functional case elements like screws and bores exposed, instead of hiding them away. The modernist aesthetic was a huge success for IWC, and the Ingenieur has become a horological icon. This fantastic example features the brand's other speciality, the perpetual calendar, with a perfect Ingenieur-faithful design interpretation.

                            If you're a big fan of Panerai, the legendary Italian watchmaker, chances are you've encountered Paneristi.com, the “unofficial resource” and forum where collectors and enthusiasts meet and discuss everything Panerai-related. In a spectacular gesture of good will towards its loyal supporters, the brand itself agreed to create a very limited run of watches in collaboration with the Paneristi site moderators themselves. PVD case, painted patina dial, OP logo, and even a special caseback inscription that commemorates the forum's 10th anniversary—this is the ultimate Panerai for collectors. Competition to own one couldn't have been more fierce.

                            Given the Big Bang's origins, with its porthole-inspired design, there have been nautical themes in the collection from the start—if faint ones. So when it came time for Hublot to create its first “serious” diving watch, it made some sense to turn to the King Power, the even bigger, bolder version of the already spectacular Big Bang series. Hublot was never going to do things by halves. Made of lightweight carbon fibre, this “Oceanographic” has a beastly 48mm case distinguished by the monstrous crown at 2 o'clock (its smaller brother at 4 o'clock is for the inner bezel), and a super-legible dial. The crystal is a massive 6.5mm thick, providing the immense water resistance that would keep this extraordinary watch safe and sound on the ocean floor.

                            The Luminor 127 is a unique and very special watch in the Panerai pantheon, one close to the hearts of many collectors and affectionately nicknamed the “Fiddy”. First released in 2002, it is an uncanny recreation of a gorgeous vintage timepiece from 1950 (hence the limited edition number), and is known for many important features. For a start, it is 47mm in diameter, a large size with which the brand would subsequently become associated (some claim that Panerai were the ones who launched the whole oversize trend). Then there's the unique form of sandwich dial, rarely seen before, which combined with the crown guard and domed sapphire crystal to create an extremely cool aura of vintage Italian style—one that few others have achieved.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they're among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79350, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.
