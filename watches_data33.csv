                            When Patek Philippe released the Aquanaut in 1997 it was considered part of the Gerald Genta-designed Nautilus collection and shared some of its famous design elements, including the rounded octagonal bezel that drew inspiration from a porthole. It was also the first Patek Philippe to come on a rubber strap. Having branched off from the Nautilus family and gone its own way, it’s now a popular watch within the brand’s catalogue and is perhaps its sportiest model, combining a dynamic and compact design with casual elegance. This model, with a khaki grenade-pattern dial featuring applied Arabic numerals in white gold, comes on a matching green rubber strap. The white gold case, a fraction over 42mm, houses the automatic Caliber 324 S C which holds a power reserve of up to 45 hours. The movement is visible through the case back, revealing the 21k gold rotor engraved with the brand’s Calatrava cross and decorated with côte de Genève stripes.

                            Named after the speedway track in Florida that hosts a legendary, Rolex-sponsored twenty-four hour race, the Daytona is the quintessential driver’s watch and was given a boost in popularity when Hollywood icon Paul Newman wore an early version of it. The dial, with its three subdials, is clear and easy to read while a tachymeter on the bezel offers quick speed calculations. It’s powered by Rolex’s Caliber 4130 automatic chronograph movement which holds a power reserve of 72 hours. Introduced in 1963 it’s been in continuous production ever since, although this particular reference is discontinued. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. With a black and gold colourway, this Daytona offers an understated bit of bling via its yellow gold case, as well as some additional sporty appeal thanks to its comfortable black rubber strap.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This incredible 40mm model in 18k Everose gold features a spellbinding sunburst dial that stands out beautifully within the black bezel. Presented on a black rubber Oysterflex bracelet, this is a spectacular timepiece that is currently one of the most sought-after watches around.

This version in white gold is notable for its black and red dial, which features Arabic numerals—unusual for a Daytona. It’s the perfect watch for anyone looking for an iconic Rolex model that is instantly recognisable yet noticeably different to most Daytona models in circulation.

                            The Royal Oak was an industry revelation on its release in 1972, becoming the first luxury steel sports watch—with a luxury price to match. Probably Gerald Genta’s most famous watch design, it stood in stark contrast to other watches owing to its octagonal bezel and robust integrated bracelet, one of the most distinctive ever designed. This stunning chronograph version in striking 18-carat yellow gold is now discontinued and features a silvered tapisserie dial, giving it  exquisite depth and texture, together with gold details including the hands and markers. The three sub-dials feature hours, minutes and small seconds, and there’s also a date aperture between 4 and 5 o’clock. It runs on an AP Caliber 2385 automatic movement which holds a power reserve of around 40 hours. A high-quality black alligator strap enhances the look of unbridled luxury with which this now-iconic watch is synonymous.

                            The ref 6263 is one of the most coveted models from the most desirable watch family of all time: the Rolex Daytona. Rolex manufactured the 6263 from 1971 to 1988 in relatively low numbers. It features an evolution of the iconic screw-down pushers, first seen in ref 6240, that gave the Cosmograph such strong water resistance, and which gives the 6263 its distinct Daytona 'look'. It runs on the workhorse Valjoux 72 movement, making the watch more than durable enough for everyday wear, despite its remarkable vintage.
