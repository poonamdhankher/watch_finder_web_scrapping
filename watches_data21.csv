                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            When Buzz Aldrin stepped out of the lunar module, codenamed ‘Eagle’, and onto the powdery surface of the moon, the Omega Speedmaster on his wrist became the legendary Moonwatch. Tested to the limits by NASA for the rigours of space flight, the Speedmaster had in fact been into space before the testing had even begun. In October 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra took his own personal Speedmaster on board Sigma 7 and orbited Earth a total of six times for the Mercury 7 mission. The Speedmaster continued to provide NASA astronauts with invaluable service for the Apollo 13 mission, when it was used to time the crucial burn that would return the astronauts safely to Earth.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.
