                            It was in 1904 that Louis Cartier gave a watch to his good friend and aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont that was designed to be worn on the wrist. The Santos watch was the first ever men's wristwatch, originally invented to make it easier to check the time while flying. It was a game-changer in the industry thanks to Santos-Dumont's huge popularity and fame, as well as a very early example of the iconic Art Deco style that would influence fashion and watchmaking for decades. The modern Santos watches maintain the classic hallmarks of the original, including the rounded square case, Roman numerals and fully incorporated lugs.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with high quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage while daring to forge its own path, boasting an energetic modern design with classic racing-red highlights, along with superb finishing and the excellent calibre 16 inside.
