                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history. This exceptionally rare GMT limited edition, boasting an advanced aerospace-grade titanium case, was made exclusively for Royal Navy crew members who operate a Merlin helicopter—an image of which can be seen on the dial.

                            The de Havilland DH-88 Comet was a legendary aircraft known for setting a string of extraordinary records in the 1930s. The plane was built for the famous MacRobertson Air Race from London to Melbourne in 1934 because there were no other British aircraft suitable for entry. Three teams flew DH-88 Comets on the race, and one of them, named Grosvenor House, won it—setting a new record of just under three days, despite the two pilots having to deal with severe exhaustion and mechanical failures. This fantastic limited edition commemorates this remarkable chapter with gorgeous rose gold and steel GMT timepieces that incorporates a fragment of original spruce plywood from the undercarriage of Grosvenor House in the rotor. Proceeds from sales were donated by Bremont to the Shuttleworth Trust to help maintain the aircraft, which continues to give regular displays.

                            The Big Bang has long been prized for its bold, uncompromising design and innovative use of new materials. Drawing on and expanding the porthole and fusion ideas of previous Hublot watches, the Big Bang was instantly hailed as outstanding when launched in 2005, and is now firmly established as one of the most iconic sports watches of the 21st century. But it wasn't until more recently that the watch really came into its own with the addition of Hublot's proprietary Unico movement, made entirely in-house. A major milestone for the brand, the Unico stars in a new series of Big Bangs with gorgeously skeletonised dials, such as the superb carbon fibre, flyback model on offer here.

                            Nicolas Rieussec was the first collection launched by Montblanc after the company took control of the prestigious Minerva manufacture in Villeret. The watches are named after the French inventor of the chronograph, which was originally a device that measured intervals by moving a pen in contact with rotating paper, drawing an arc as it went (hence the name chronograph, from the Greek for “time-writing”). The Nicolas Rieussec watches were also the first to house an in-house Montblanc movement, propelling the brand into the upper echelons of haute horlogerie. Matching tradition with innovation, this stunning watch is a monopusher column-wheel chrono, with a second timezone on the main dial paired with a day/night indicator that mirrors the date window.

                            During its tenure as official Formula 1 Timekeeper between 2010 and 2013, Hublot created a number of highly collectible limited edition watches to commemorate this partnership. Here we have a very special model, available in only 100 pieces worldwide, with a remarkable red-tinted crystal and a stunning, skeletonised dial. This unique King Power watch has a large ceramic case and sandblasted bezel. The Big Bang has long been prized for its bold, uncompromising designs and innovative use of new materials, and is now firmly established as one of the most iconic sports watches of the 21st century.

                            Featuring the in-house calibre UN-170 movement, boasting an impressive power reserve of 170 hours, the Skeleton Tourbillon features advanced silicium technology. Released in 2014 after a standout display at Baselworld a year prior, the Skeleton Tourbillon Manufacture is an excellent example of a skeleton watch—down to the leaf-shaped hour and minute hands, whose tips are also skeletonised. As in the name, even the tourbillon itself is impressively skeletonised, being a first for the watchmaker. Ulysse Nardin even designed the tourbillon from scratch, opting out of simply skeletonising one of its existing movements. Perfect for collectors, being very rare, this stunning watch is limited to just 99 pieces in both white and rose gold.

                            Describing its aesthetic as elegant, simple and creative, Vacheron Constantin has continually aimed to enhance and reinvent the art of fine watchmaking since its introduction over 265 years ago, cementing its place within the top three watchmakers in the world. This Patrimony exists within a classic line of Traditionnelle watches, and features a stunning open-worked, skeletonised dial that perfectly shows off the beautiful inner workings of the calibre 1003 SQRH. This movement features 118 components and 18 jewels that oscillate at 28,800vph plus a 31-hour power reserve. The movement, fitted with a solid 22-karat gold oscillating rotor, is also certified with the Hallmark of Geneva. With its striking white gold dial, bezel and black alligator strap, this watch is a bonafide head-turner.
