                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 44mm sports watch in striking monochrome.

                            This wonderful black dial Luminor features striking white displays for small seconds and – more unusually – the power reserve. The Luminor design originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military-only contractor. It somewhat modernised the Panerai look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the distinctive cushion case, and a crown guard to boost water resistance. This model has a lightweight titanium case with a depth rating of 300m, and is powered by the OP IX movement.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            This extraordinary limited edition is an almost exact reissue of the iconic first watch made by Officine Panerai in 1936 for the Royal Italian Navy. At that time, Panerai was making technical instruments (depth gauges, compasses, even torpedo launchers) but not watches. To make the watch, it bought cushion cases, purely because they were popular at the time, and movements from Rolex. It added a new Panerai invention: radiomir, a luminous material to make the watches legible in the dark. The watch was so well made that it passed all the military tests with flying colours, and has remained a legend in Panerai history ever since. There are no brand markings on the famous California dial in order to prevent the enemy discovering the navy's supplier, should the watch fall into the wrong hands.

                            The Air King was named in honour of the brave RAF pilots of WWII, when Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, discovered they were ditching their standard issue watches for his Oyster Perpetual. As one of its longest continuously manufactured and most affordable watches, the Air King is a beloved staple of Rolex's range. At Baselworld 2016, the brand released this superbly updated model. It refreshes the classic look, upgrading size, durability and calibre precision while staying true to its aviation heritage in such key elements as the iconic 1950s Air-King font. Many believe that the dial design is inspired by the custom dashboard timepieces Rolex supplied to the Bloodhound SSC land speed record attempt.

                            When Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to reach the summit of Everest in 1953, their expedition team were supplied with watches by Rolex and the British company Smith’s. Rolex designed a watch specifically for the expedition, which came to be known as the Explorer, one of the less prominent models in the Rolex stable but one that has been a constant since its launch. A far plainer looking watch back then, the Explorer aesthetic is now characterised by the Mercedes hour hand, three-quarter numeral black dial and Oyster bracelet. This model, with a 36mm case, is the first to come in two-tone steel and yellow gold and runs on a Caliber 3230 which holds a power reserve of almost 70 hours.

                            Panerai has several watches with amazingly long power reserves, yet even by its standards, this 8-day Radiomir is pretty darn cool. The watch harnesses three large mainspring barrels to generate this much power, and the superb mechanical specs of the in-house P.2002 movement ensure that this energy is distributed cleanly and evenly without any compromise of timekeeping precision. In addition to the power reserve, which has a 'linear' display at 6 o'clock, the watch also boasts a stunning black aesthetic made possible by the extraordinary ceramic case material, formed from the isostatic pressing of zirconium oxide.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This incredible 40mm model in 18k Everose gold features a spellbinding sunburst dial that stands out beautifully within the black bezel. Presented on a black rubber Oysterflex bracelet, this is a spectacular timepiece that is currently one of the most sought-after watches around.
