                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. These watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, staying remarkably true to its historic legacy.

                            Named after the quaint Alpine village where the company's workshops are located, the Villeret collection undoubtedly comprises Blancpain's most classic and elegant watches. Like the town of Villeret itself, the watches are rooted in the oldest and most admirable qualities of Swiss watchmaking. The aesthetic is understated but confident in its exquisite design and finishing of premium quality materials. All of Blancpain's 300 years of experience at the very highest levels of haute horlogerie is brought to bear in this beautiful series. This particularly excellent model features a complete set of calendar and moonphase complications, marking it as a superb example of high-end mechanical accomplishment.

                            The Seamaster is one of the most iconic diving watches of all time. By the 1950s, it was among the most dependable and professionally sought dive watches from any brand, and it soon pioneered some of the sporty must-have features we associate with such watches, including unidirectional bezels, phosphorescent hands and the helium escape valve. The year 2005 saw the launch of a modern classic: the Seamaster Planet Ocean. This collection bursts with innovative style and energy, its design clearly rooted in Seamaster heritage yet daring to be original at the same time. The Planet Ocean's popularity only soared after being spotted on the wrist of Daniel Craig's James Bond in Casino Royale and its sequels.
