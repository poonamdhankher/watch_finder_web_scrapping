                            This superb, understated Radiomir features Panerai's special ceramic case material. It's called “composite” instead of ceramic to differentiate it from the ceramics of other watchmakers, which are typically made with a zirconium base. Panerai's is created by electrochemical processes using aluminium, making it harder and tougher than other ceramics, not to mention lighter than even titanium. Not only is the watch made with unique, cutting edge materials, but it also features a highly prestigious in-house movement. P.3000 has a power reserve of three days and a allows the hour to be set in discrete jumps without interfering with the workings of the seconds or minutes.

                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. Three limited edition pieces created at this time set the style for what would soon become Luminor. It somewhat modernised the 1940s-era look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the distinctive cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, with a a specialised GMT function and an impressive three-day power reserve, thanks to the stunning in-house movement P.9001.
