                            This technically superlative IWC features a “double” or “split seconds” chronograph, one of the most difficult and challenging mechanical complications in high-end watchmaking. Where a regular chronograph simply records time elapsed between pushing the start and stop buttons, a split seconds chrono allows you to time laps or intermediate intervals. There are in fact two seconds hands, one of them ingeniously hidden; an extra pusher at 10 o'clock stops the first hand, recording the initial time, while the other seconds hand continues to run. The impressive complication is particularly welcome in IWC's wonderful Portuguese collection, long famed for its peerless elegance and classic aesthetics.

                            This exceptional diving watch from the Master Compressor collection of Jaeger-LeCoultre, one of Switzerland's most prestigious and desirable watch brands, has many stand-out features. The energetic-yet-elegant, blue, white and black design is immediately attention grabbing, and closer inspection only reveals yet greater marvels. Calibre 979 features a world timer GMT complication, showing the time in all 24 zones simultaneously, easily adjusted by the crown at 4. The crowns themselves boast an innovative “butterfly collar” design (as opposed to simple screw-down) that ensures water resistance. Most impressive, however, is the rare mechanical depth gauge on the left of the case, with the depth displayed up to 80m by the blue hand from the centre.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they are among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79240, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            The Altiplano collection is known for its extraordinary elegance and ultra-thin cases (a recent record-setting watch measured 3.65mm high). This “Double Jeu” model is no exception: while the total thinness is 11.7mm, this is spread across two stunning cases (both in rose gold). The top one flips on a subtly integrated hinge to reveal the second dial, each with its own movement. The lower uses the incredible 830P ultra-thin (just 2.5mm), while the upper has the 838P—the only difference being the small seconds dial and the ability to admire it through the middle caseback. Each dial has its own crown, allowing for multiple timezone settings, while the watch is opened by the latch at 3 o'clock.

                            Audemars Piguet sponsored the Alinghi Team at the world-famous America's Cup for most of the 2000s, including its major wins in 2003 and 2007. This watch was the last of the special editions made in honour of Alinghi, here seen in a stunningly rare and collectible gold version limited to just 600 pieces. The watch boasts a very special ten-minute countdown complication designed especially for use at regattas, and is also notable for being one of the first watches ever to make use of forged carbon in the phenomenal bezel. This cutting-edge material, pioneered by Audemars Piguet, is even stronger and lighter than most kinds of carbon fibres.

                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 44mm sports watch in striking monochrome.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they are among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79240, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            As part of the Windrider series, the Cockpit combines the best of Breitling design in a smaller, more elegant case. Many other Breitlings are too large for some people to wear comfortably, so this 41mm case size makes a refreshing change for those who like the brand but don’t want an oversized watch—and the 14mm height is also not unwieldy. Much more rarely encountered on the market than other Breitling watch families, the Cockpit cuts to the core of the brand's aviation-based appeal, while updating the design with the best of modern manufacturing. As with every Breitling, the build quality and finish are fantastic. The gold elements on the case and dial of this model are particularly attractive.
