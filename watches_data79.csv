                            Corum has launched a number of highly unusual designs since its launch in 1955, with notable models including its heritage coin watches—made using real gold coins—and even a watch with a dial coated in a genuine bird’s feather. Its first Golden Bridge model was launched in 1980 and the collection is characterised by a baguette-shaped manual movement that spans the dial from top to bottom and is displayed through the transparent dial and caseback. It remains a unique construction in the world of fine watchmaking and is one of the most striking skeleton dials around. The tonneau-shaped case is made from yellow gold and the crown is located at the bottom of the case rather than the side, adding to its highly unorthodox aesthetic.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history (this piece is inspired by its twin-engined Model 247 airliner from the 1930s). The partnership also involves the extraordinary expertise of the University of Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC), to achieve the highest quality precision engineering. The watches are tested to the toughest levels of endurance.

                            This Panerai Radiomir is 1 of 1000 made and features a ‘tropical’ dial. 
The watch’s dial has been fashioned to resemble the patina seen on vintage Panerai watches which have suffered the effects of radioactive exposure. The Radiomir paint in the vintage watches emitted gamma rays, from the radioactive Radium, and aged the watch in a fashion which turned the originally black paint to a light brown colour. 
Brevetatto, the Italian for patented, is inscribed around the bezel and refers to the design of the watch which adheres to a vintage aesthetic, Panerai have used a 12-sided bezel like those found on prototype watches from the 1930’s.
