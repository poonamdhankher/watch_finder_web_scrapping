                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 44mm sports watch with a striking colour scheme.

                            Bremont describes the Supermarine collection as “divers watches inspired by our aviation principles”. This doesn't mean the Supermarine is a pilot's watch, but rather a traditional, good-looking and high-grade diver that is—at heart—a Bremont. Demonstrating the brand's no-nonsense British clarity and effortless sense of refinement, the Supermarine also boasts the impressive technical credentials for which Bremont, a relatively small independent brand, is rightly acclaimed. The watch uses Bremont's anti-shock mount, a Faraday cage and a helium escape valve to make itself seriously durable. Meanwhile, accuracy is guaranteed by the Swiss chronometer inside, lovingly embellished and assembled in Bremont's Henley factory.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. A variant on the regular 116710, this reference features gold elements in the bezel, crown, hands, indices and of course the bracelet.

                            The modern Luminor design originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military-only contractor. Three limited edition pieces created at this time set the style for what would soon become modern Luminor. It somewhat modernised the 1940s-era look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the distinctive cushion case, and a crown guard to boost water resistance. This lovely example has an in-house movement, the P.3002, with a power reserve of three days that is displayed in a sophisticated retrograde indicator on the dial.

                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. These watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, staying remarkably true to its historic legacy.

                            Luxury watchmaking in England was given a welcome boost with the launch of Bremont in 2002. Founded by brothers Giles and Nick English, it began by making beautifully crafted pilots’ watches, most of which are ISO chronometer rated, and has brought out a number of intriguing limited editions that incorporate history into the actual watch in the most literal sense. This model features an actual piece of fabric used on the 1903 Wright Flyer aircraft that marked the beginning of the pioneer era of aviation. It can be seen through the transparent caseback, as can the automatic movement, which is powered by a rotor that bears the words ‘Wright Flyer’, the initials of the Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville, and a delightful propellor design. This hugely collectible watch, with a 50-hour power reserve, is one of just 300 pieces.
