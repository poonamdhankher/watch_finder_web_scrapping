                            Binding classical watchmaking tradition with modern creativity, the Audemars Piguet Millenary is as playful and unique as it is mesmerising to behold. The collection builds its neo-classical aesthetic by taking inspiration from the best of traditional watchmaking and reimagining it for the third millennium. The Millenary is known for its superb oval case that provides room to play with circular, off-centre sub-dials that overlap in pleasing arrangements. This is the perfect watch for those who want to showcase their avant-guard taste while remaining true to the peerless Audemars Piguet heritage.

                            Originating in Florence, Tuscany, Panerai has a long history of making stylish and extremely reliable watches for professional divers, beginning with its famed WWII contract for the Italian Navy's “Frogmen”. The PAM Submersible pieces are among Panerai's finest diving tools. This superb example features a super-tough black carbon fibre (‘Carbotech’) case and bezel with graduated scale. The watch runs on the in-house P.9000 movement, which boasts a 3-day power reserve from two barrels and allows the wearer to change the time in convenient 1-hour increments. The matching black factory strap is made of a durable rubber that is perfect for diving.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilots' watches. Created by the legendary designer Gerald Genta in the 1970s, the watch was allegedly inspired by a diving helmet, giving Genta the relatively new idea of leaving the functional case elements like screws and bores exposed, instead of hiding them away. The modernist aesthetic was a huge success for IWC, and the Ingenieur has become a horological icon. This fantastic example features the brand's other speciality, the perpetual calendar, with a perfect Ingenieur-faithful design interpretation.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilots' watches. Created by the legendary designer Gerald Genta in the 1970s, the watch was allegedly inspired by a diving helmet, giving Genta the relatively new idea of leaving the functional case elements like screws and bores exposed, instead of hiding them away. The modernist aesthetic was a huge success for IWC, and the Ingenieur has become a horological icon. This fantastic example features the brand's other speciality, the perpetual calendar, with a perfect Ingenieur-faithful design interpretation.

                            This extraordinary Hublot limited edition was made in honour of the Yacht Club de Monaco, and in particular of its flagship beauty, the Tuiga. Built in the legendary William Fife boatyard, Scotland, Tuiga has enjoyed more than a century of prestigious sailing. It was purchased for the Club in 1995 by HSH Prince Albert II, and continues to valiantly represent its values and maritime heritage at major regattas. Originally inspired by the portholes on similar vessels, the Big Bang has a maritime history of its own, making it the perfect choice to commemorate the Tuiga in this very special edition, with a tantalum case and ceramic bezel. An image of the vessel is depicted on the exhibition caseback.

                            This superb, understated Radiomir features Panerai's special ceramic case material. It's called “composite” instead of ceramic to differentiate it from the ceramics of other watchmakers, which are typically made with a zirconium base. Panerai's is created by electrochemical processes using aluminium, making it harder and tougher than other ceramics, not to mention lighter than even titanium. Not only is the watch made with unique, cutting edge materials, but it also features a highly prestigious in-house movement. P.3000 has a power reserve of three days and a allows the hour to be set in discrete jumps without interfering with the workings of the seconds or minutes.

                            The Luminor 127 is a unique and very special watch in the Panerai pantheon, one close to the hearts of many collectors and affectionately nicknamed the “Fiddy”. First released in 2002, it is an uncanny recreation of a gorgeous vintage timepiece from 1950 (hence the limited edition number), and is known for many important features. For a start, it is 47mm in diameter, a large size with which the brand would subsequently become associated (some claim that Panerai were the ones who launched the whole oversize trend). Then there's the unique form of sandwich dial, rarely seen before, which combined with the crown guard and domed sapphire crystal to create an extremely cool aura of vintage Italian style—one that few others have achieved.

                            The Radiomir collection is named after the distinctive luminescent compound Panerai developed when it sold watches to the Italian Navy in the 1930s. Today it is known for several beloved characteristics that have made it an icon of horology—big cushion case; vintage, legible design; sandwich dial; onion crown; and leather strap. Here we have a gorgeous 47mm limited edition in polished pink gold that positively gleams on the wrist. Known as the Ora Rosa, this version features a superb, paired-down dial. The transparent caseback allows the owner to examine the stunning in-house movement P.3000, which boasts two barrels and three days of power.

                            This special Luminor pays tribute to some of the brand's vintage early 20th century models, when Panerai was making “Marina Militare” watches for the Italian and Egyptian Navies. One rare timepiece built for the latter, the GPF 2/56, became legendary for its huge 66mm size and “Angelus” movement with an eight day power reserve. It had the words “8 giorni brevettato” (“8 days patented”) written around a circle on the dial, a mark which has since become something of a Panerai holy symbol. Only a tiny number of modern references also have this marking, of which this wonderful PAM 590 is one. The modern, in-house P.5000 movement also has an impressive power reserve of eight days, while the caseback has an engraving of a Frogman with his SLC human torpedo (another iconic chapter of Panerai history).

                            The “California” style dial, famous for its combination of Roman numerals, Arabic numerals and regular indexes, as well as the lack of brand name or other lettering, was used in Panerai's very earliest watches from the 1930s. The name comes from a company in California that was known for refurbishing many such dials. The 448 is based very closely on the original prototype Californias commissioned in 1936 by the Royal Italian Navy. This modern version with superb finishing is particularly delightful thanks to the stunning case, authentic black dial and the blue hands and minute track that go so nicely with it.
