                            Having a date indicator on a watch is taken for granted these days, but before 1945, the concept didn't exist at all—that is until Rolex added a simple, yet game-changing element to their famous Oyster watch: the date window. This small aperture changed the role of wristwatches from then on, from mere timekeeping devices to calendars as well. The Datejust was (and is) also known for its classic elegance—the watch is striking in its magnificent, minimalist beauty. Many of these timepieces feature dials or cases made with rare and exquisite materials, which only adds to their graceful and luxurious reputation. In 2009 the look was slightly adjusted and modernised with the Datejust II—the main difference being the change in case size from 36 to 41mm.

                            Originally an ancient fortress in Spain, Calatrava was the site of key medieval battles between Christian and Muslim forces and the foundation of the noble brotherhood of religious knights, the Order of Calatrava. The emblem of these knights was to be adopted many centuries later by perhaps Switzerland's most prestigious and revered watchmaker of all time, Patek Philippe, as the brand logo. And its flagship watch collection was bestowed the name Calatrava in honour of this historical connection. Calatrava watches are among the most elegant and distinguished in the world, displaying a flawless, understated stylishness rooted in the finest Swiss traditions, combined with the avant-guard aesthetic in vogue at the time of the first Calatravas in the early 1930s.

                            This Rolex Daytona Cosmograph was designed to meet the needs of professional racing drivers upon its original release in 1963, with a reliable chronograph and bezel with tachymetric scale, allowing drivers to measure average speeds of up to 400 MPH. The name nods to Daytona, Florida—the home of a strong passion for speed and motor racing that emerged in the early 20th century. The relationship between Rolex and motor racing strengthened in 2013 when the watchmaker decided to enter the world of Formula 1, as Global Partner and Official Timepiece of the exhilarating sport. The 116520 introduced the in-house calibre 4130, a replacement to the Zenith-sourced 4030 in the previous 16520 and has become one of the most popular sports models ever created.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with high quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage while daring to forge its own path.

                            Born as the amalgamation of incredible new technologies developed by Rolex, COMEX (the French deep-sea diving company) and the US Navy during the late 60s, the Sea-Dweller is Rolex's ultra-durable dive computer. In production for more than four decades, the 16600 model featured such pioneering technology as a helium escape valve and a 1,220m water resistance, and received a major upgrade in the form of the 116660 Deepsea model seen here. With a three-piece “Ringlock” case, “Triplock” crown system and 5mm sapphire crystal, this watch can survive pressures that would flatten a submarine. Its water resistance rating is an incredible 3,900m—deeper than the average depth of the ocean.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors.

                            Like many of its iconic watch families, Rolex's Milgauss was created in 1956 with a specific market in mind: scientists, power station workers and anyone else exposed to high magnetic fields. It was designed to be able to resist fields up to 1,000 gauss (hence the name—“mille” is Latin for thousand). The watch built a solid reputation with only two models until 1988, and was happily revived two decades later in a modern re-edition that remains faithful to the original purpose and aesthetics—including the beloved lightning bolt hand. This gorgeous GV version (Glace Verte) has a green-tinted dial crystal, and uses a Parachrom-Blu hairspring for even better magnetic and shock resistance.

                            The GMT Master was first commissioned in the 1950s by pioneering airline Pan Am, and was designed for aviation. An increase in flight distances created demand for a watch that was able to tell the time in two different parts of the world simultaneously, so Rolex built it with an additional hand that could be set to a second time zone. By the 1980s, the watch had developed into the GMT Master II and was already a favourite among collectors. This model represents a significant upgrade for the watch, boasting an aerospace-grade steel case and cerachrom inserts in the bezel. A variant on the regular 116710, this reference features gold elements in the bezel, crown, hands, indices and of course the bracelet.

                            The Air King was named in honour of the brave RAF pilots of WWII, when Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, discovered they were ditching their standard issue watches for his Oyster Perpetual. As one of its longest continuously manufactured and most affordable watches, the Air King is a beloved staple of Rolex's range. At Baselworld 2016, the brand released this superbly updated model. It refreshes the classic look, upgrading size, durability and calibre precision while staying true to its aviation heritage in such key elements as the iconic 1950s Air-King font. Many believe that the dial design is inspired by the custom dashboard timepieces Rolex supplied to the Bloodhound SSC land speed record attempt.

                            The Ballon Bleu, one of Cartier's newest watch collections, has been hugely successful since its 2007 release. With a unique, curving, organic case, a cleverly integrated sapphire crown and a multi-facetted guilloché dial, the watch can rightly be called a gem in every sense, blending the best of classical elegance and futuristic originality. Creating beauty through simplicity, the watch showcases everything that makes Cartier such a prestigious and highly-sought brand. This model uses a superb Swiss automatic movement underneath the traditional Roman numerals and blue sword hands on the dial. It's a timepiece that has to been seen in the flesh to get the full effect.

                            Invented in the 1930s as one of the first wristwatches made to be as precise as a marine chronometer, the Portuguese collection has a long history, though it wasn't produced in serious numbers until the 1990s. Today they are among IWC's finest watches, beloved by collectors for their graceful, uncluttered design and classic aesthetic featuring thin bezels and sword-like hands. This exquisite model runs on an automatic movement, IWC calibre 79240, with a superb chronograph mechanism. Adding a dash of sporting appeal to this elegant watch, the chrono display is subtly integrated and in no way detracts from the clean, sophisticated design.

                            Originally an evolution of its early automatics, the IWC Ingenieur was designed to combine the self-winding movement with the shock and magnetic resistance pioneered in some of the brand's pilot's watches. While the concept was successful and enjoyed various upgrades (including input from the legendary Gerald Genta), it was beginning to peter out in the early naughties. Seeking to refresh the collection, IWC partnered with Mercedes' high performance division, AMG, to create a series of cutting-edge timepieces that demonstrated both brands' commitment to the highest precision engineering. This model is made from zirconium-based ceramic, inspired by AMG's disc brakes, and houses the famous in-house Caliber 80110.
