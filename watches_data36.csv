                            The Luminor design originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market—though it remained firmly rooted in the look and feel of the military watches of the '30s and '40s when the company was born. The new watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, with a clear and legible dial boasting stunning luminova indices and hands.

                            The PAM 569 “Titanio” is a wonderful example of that rare beast in Panerai legend: the left-handed Luminor. Confusingly, Panerai calls these watches “destro”—Italian for “right”. That's because the watch is designed to be worn on the right hand, hence placing the crown on the left. However, this extraordinary limited edition is even more standout than other destro pieces like the 026. Hailing from the brand's impressive Submersible series, this is a rugged, practical titanium diving watch with a handsome, muscular aesthetic. The positioning of the date window at 9 o'clock accentuates the originality of the destro design, which is further perfected with the faux-patina luminova and hobnail dial, not to mention the superb in-house calibre P.9000.

                            Sleek, menacing and black as night, the PAM 441's dark allure is not the result of any external PVD or DLC. It's a fully ceramic case, much harder than steel and amazingly durable, the result of an exceptionally long and arduous process of diamond-wheel machining and microglass blasting to achieve the gorgeous matt finish. The material is too hard to mould and is originally created by extreme isostatic pressing of zirconium oxide followed by sintering at around 1,500°C. The beautiful in-house P.9000 movement has an impressive power reserve of three days and also features a GMT complication.

                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. Effortlessly legible, clean and elegant, the chronograph is nevertheless a rugged and imposing 46mm sports watch with a silver, black and yellow colour scheme inspired by the brand's work in the Galapagos Islands.

                            TAG Heuer's Calibre 12 LS automatic chronograph is remarkable for many reasons. The most immediately striking is the gorgeous racing watch design based on the iconic shape of the Monaco, one of the best loved drivers' watches in the world. But the Calibre 12 is not just a pretty red, white and black face. It has also developed an innovative and stunning new way of showing the time: the LS “linear system”, which gives many of the subdials a resemblance to classic dashboard indicators. At the top is the date window, where a whole section of the wheel is purposely visible. Then there's the unique retrograde seconds at 3 o'clock, which uses different coloured “hands” to show half a minute in a line, one after another. Finally the two chronograph counters: hours at 6 o'clock is comparatively conventional, while the 30 minute counter at 9 o'clock is a speedometer; like the seconds, two hands count 15 minutes each. The effect is breathtaking.

                            The Luminor as we know it originated in the early 1990s, when Panerai finally decided to sell its prestigious watches to the civilian market after more than 50 years as a military contractor. These watches somewhat modernised the iconic look while remaining true to the brand's historical aesthetics, adding strong clean lines and new curves to the powerful cushion case, and a crown guard to boost muscle and water resistance. Here the legendary Luminor is available in all its classic glory, staying remarkably true to its historic legacy.

                            Hublot burst onto the Swiss watchmaking scene in 1980 with the most groundbreaking new design that the industry had seen in years. The idea was simple: a luxury gold watch made in the bold “porthole” style, but fitted with a rubber bracelet. The idea of “Fusion” was born—and innovative combinations of materials have remained a key part of the Hublot brand ever since. This extra special piece harks back to Fusion with a glorious skeletonised design that allows for a spectacular view of the ultra-thin movement and its 90-hour power reserve. As ever, the materials are remarkable: there's a stunning titanium case, bezel and screws, a ruthenium anthracite mainplate and bridges, all paired with a fine leather strap.
