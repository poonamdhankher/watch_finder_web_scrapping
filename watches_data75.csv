                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, continuing Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with timing instruments. Named after the intense 'Carrera Panamerica' road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera has long been sought to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams. This addition to the Carrera collection fully embodies that racing heritage with its large 60-second chronograph counter, as well as racing-themed colouring and tachymeter scale on the bezel.

                            Before the legendary Calibre 360, which made headlines as the first mechanical chronograph movement capable of measuring hundredths of a second, there was the Calibre 36. Equally legendary, in its way, the 36 can count tenths of a second thanks to its super-high frequency of 5Hz (most high-end chronographs beat at 4Hz). This might remind you of another famous chronograph movement, and you'd be right: the Calibre 36 is a modified version of Zenith's El Primero—ironic, considering Heuer and Zenith were competitors in the famous 1969 race to build the first automatic chrono—although this one has been upgraded with additional flyback capability. This gorgeous, cutting-edge Carrera evolves the remarkable Mikrograph design with a silver ring encompassing a gloriously brushed anthracite centre.
