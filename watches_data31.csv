                            The Cartier Tank, inspired by an actual tank, has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.

                            The classic Explorer I has always been a firm favourite amongst enthusiasts, its heritage and good looks being very hard to resist. Established in the public mind after Rolex’s involvement in the pioneering ascent of Everest with Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, the Explorer I has a delightfully clear, readable face, uncluttered by a date complication. The case is smoother and more rounded than other Rolex sports models, even more so than it initially appears.

                            Bremont describes the Supermarine collection as “divers watches inspired by our aviation principles”. This doesn't mean the Supermarine is a pilot's watch, but rather a traditional, good-looking and high-grade diver that is—at heart—a Bremont. Demonstrating the brand's no-nonsense British clarity and effortless sense of refinement, the Supermarine also boasts the impressive technical credentials for which Bremont, a relatively small independent brand, is rightly acclaimed. The watch uses Bremont's anti-shock mount, a Faraday cage and a helium escape valve to make itself seriously durable. Meanwhile, accuracy is guaranteed by the Swiss chronometer inside, lovingly embellished and assembled in Bremont's Henley factory.

                            The watch is limited edition and was created as a tribute to the legendary pilot's watch, the 'Cairelli' CP2 .

This re-edition timepiece stays true to the aesthetic and size of the original CP2, which was first produced for the Italian Air Force in the 1960's, by the watchmaker A.Cairelli. The watch features a bi-directional bezel and lumed hands on a matte black dial, making the piece as functional as a pilots watch as the original timepiece. 

The vintage style pump pushers and applied Zenith pointed star on the dial complete the aesthetic of the piece, an accurate and detailed re-edition of a much loved vintage pilot's watch.
