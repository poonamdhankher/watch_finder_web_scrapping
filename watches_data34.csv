                            The Royal Oak was an industry revelation on its release in 1972, becoming the first luxury steel sports watch—with a luxury price to match. Probably Gerald Genta’s most famous watch design, it stood in stark contrast to other watches owing to its octagonal bezel and robust integrated bracelet, one of the most distinctive ever designed. This remarkable Dual Time version in an 18k rose gold 39mm case features a silver-toned ‘Tapisserie’ dial, a hallmark of the Royal Oak, as well as a calendar display, fan-form power reserve display and a second-time zone at 6 o’clock with overlapping day/night indicator. The hour markers and hands echo the rose gold case and are applied with luminescent coating for night or low-light visibility. The automatic movement within is the brand’s own calibre 2329-2846.

                            The Rotonde De Cartier offers a stark contrast to the traditional, small rectangular cases with which this brand is synonymous. It features a 40mm circular case and beautiful tourbillon on the dial—a rare example of the famed French jeweller letting its hair down. The Rotonde collection consists primarily of watches with added complications, hence the flying tourbillon seen here. Made in a stunning rose gold, the reference W1556215 houses the hand-wound calibre 9452 MC, while boasting a celebrated Geneva Seal and 142 parts and 19 jewels and a frequency of 21600 vph—all visible through the open case back. This watch is an impressive piece that is sure to turn heads with its elegant and refined looks, while displaying the very best of Cartier’s watchmaking skills.

                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This glitzy Daytona features a white gold case with a diamond-studded bezel and a white mother-of-pearl dial that boasts even more diamonds via the hour markers. This is a unique Daytona perfect for those into bedazzling timepieces.

                            The unmistakeable Luminor case, launched in 1993, was later joined by the 1950 case, introduced in 2002— inspired by the Panerai model from 1950, hence the name. A limited-edition piece of just 100 watches released, this 1950 features the in-house P.2005/B calibre movement, which boasts Panerai’s patented cage technology. This movement contains the balance wheel and escapement which rotates on an axis perpendicular to the balance, not parallel with it. This cuts the usual amount of time for a complete revolution from sixty seconds to just thirty. This reference also boasts hours, minutes, small seconds, GMT, 24-hour indicator, six-day power reserve indicator visible through the case back and a tourbillon—all presented in a slick, black ceramic case.

                            Self-proclaimed specialists in the “art of fusion”, Hublot shook up the watch world back in 2015 with its new Big Bang Tourbillion 5-Day Power Reserve Indicator. The tourbillion complication is on full display thanks to the striking, skeletonised dial, which is encased in either titanium or 18k King Gold—depending on personal preference. A limited edition watch with only 99 pieces ever made, this is hugely sought after by Hublot aficionados. After the appointment of CEO Jean-Claude Biver in 2004, Hublot released their new Big Bang series, with the objective to modernise the brand with this new, flagship collection. Unveiled at Basel in 2005, the Big Bang certainly lived up to its name, gathering a mass of fans and great acclaim. The series takes inspiration from Hublot’s original 1980 launch model, featuring the now-familiar porthole-inspired round bezel, exposed screws and rubber strap—all of which are synonymous with Hublot today.

                            This exceptional and rarely seen Breguet tourbillon and 24-hour power reserve comes from Breguet's “Classique Complication” family of truly extraordinary complex timepieces, known for fusing the very best of aesthetic and technical beauty With these astonishing timepieces, mostly released in highly limited editions, the company demonstrates its continuing command of its founder Abraham-Louis Breguet's greatest talent: utter mechanical mastery. This particular watch features a gorgeous platinum case and an exquisite engine-turned dial, as well as several impressive complications including an integrated seconds hand tourbillon at 6 o'clock (symmetrically mirroring the main display above) and retrograde indicators for the power reserve and AM/PM to the left and right respectively. The overall effect is one of classical harmony and breathtaking horological proficiency.

                            From the brand founded by arguably the greatest watchmaker ever—Louis Breguet—the Breguet Tradition 7047BR/G9/9ZU was introduced at 2012’s Baselworld. The Tradition 7047BR Tourbillon Fusee and Chain is one of the watchmaker’s most interesting watches to date. This is in part down to the 7047BR movement and its unique configuration—it is exposed on the dial side of the watch instead of the usual case back side—plus, it is protected by a tall domed sapphire crystal, which adds to its aesthetic appeal. The Tradition 7047BR comes in a 41 mm 18kt white gold or rose gold case, which is fully polished with Breguet’s signature finely fluted caseband. The dial comes in black-coated, engine-turned 18kt gold and is off-centred at 7 o’clock, while a 60-second tourbillon sits at 1 o’clock. The hand-wound manufacture movement, calibre 569, is anthracite coated and features a tourbillon and a constant force fusee and chain transmission. This Breguet is perfect for lovers of unusual watches and the industrial aesthetic.

                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            This watch is not just a classic Submariner—one of the most popular and iconic watches in the world—but a striking and highly collectible variant edition. The watch is easily recognisable thanks to its rare green bezel and dial, causing collectors to give it the affectionate nickname “Hulk”, although LV itself stands for Lunette Vert (“Green Bezel”). This larger version updates the previous LV model ref 16610 (called “Kermit”) that was originally introduced in 2003 for the 50th anniversary of the Submariner. This edition boasts ceramic inserts in the bezel, with numerals in platinum.

                            Zenith won global acclaim in 1969 when it beats its rivals to launch the world’s first automatically wound wristwatch chronograph movement. It named the watch ‘El Primero’— meaning ‘the first’ — and it remains the brand’s most recognisable watch, with numerous versions available. This all-black ‘Spindrift’ model is named after a team that participates in catamaran sailboat racing and comes in a steel-coated, matt-black DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) case, making it extremely scratch-resistant. The carbon-fibre dial opens up at 10 o’clock to reveal the escapement and there are dual chronograph counters: the 30-minute counter at 3 o’clock and the 12-hour counter at 6 o’clock. ‘Spindrift Racing’ is inscribed on the internal bezel and the team’s logo features on the rotor, seen through the exhibition caseback. Inside you’ll find Zenith’s 4061 El Primero calibre, while the power reserve is 50 hours.
