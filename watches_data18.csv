                            Launched by Rolex in 1963 as a racing chronograph, the Daytona was initially a slow seller, but the post-quartz crisis revival of mechanical watches and a famous association with Hollywood legend Paul Newman—who wore a model bought for him by his wife—has seen it become hugely desirable. Indeed, Newman’s very own watch once held the record for the most expensive wristwatch sold at auction. Once a manual-wind watch that relied on outsourced movements, the Daytona has been automatic since 1988, and is now powered by Rolex’s in-house caliber 4130, a superlative chronometer that holds a power reserve of 72 hours. This incredible 40mm model in 18ct yellow gold features a spellbinding dark green dial that stands out beautifully within the gold bezel. It’s a spectacular timepiece that is currently one of the most sought-after models around.

                            Describing its aesthetic as elegant, simple and creative, Vacheron Constantin has continually aimed to enhance and reinvent the art of fine watchmaking since its introduction over 265 years ago. The oldest Swiss watchmakers in continuous operation, it has cemented its place within the top three watchmakers in the world. Encapsulating that aesthetic, this 18-karat gold piece boasts an array of features on its dial. These comprise a leap year indicator between 1 and 2 o'clock, 30-minute recorder at 3 o'clock, date and moon phase display at 6 o'clock, small seconds at 9 o'clock and day and month windows at 12 o'clock. The manual wind movement—the Vacheron Constantin Calibre 1141 QP—is also perfectly displayed through the open case back. This watch is perfect for those after a timepiece packed full of features from one of the world’s best watchmakers.

                            The Ballon Bleu, one of Cartier's newest watch collections, has been hugely successful since its 2007 release. With a unique, curving, organic case, a cleverly integrated sapphire crown and a multi-facetted guilloché dial, the watch can rightly be called a gem in every sense, blending the best of classical elegance and futuristic originality. Creating beauty through simplicity, the watch showcases everything that makes Cartier such a prestigious and highly-sought brand. This model uses a superb Swiss automatic movement underneath the traditional Roman numerals and blue sword hands on the dial. It's a timepiece that has to been seen in the flesh to get the full effect.

                            The Air King was named in honour of the brave RAF pilots of WWII, when Hans Wilsdorf, founder of Rolex, discovered they were ditching their standard issue watches for his Oyster Perpetual. As one of its longest continuously manufactured and most affordable watches, the Air King is a beloved staple of Rolex's range. At Baselworld 2016, the brand released this superbly updated model. It refreshes the classic look, upgrading size, durability and calibre precision while staying true to its aviation heritage in such key elements as the iconic 1950s Air-King font. Many believe that the dial design is inspired by the custom dashboard timepieces Rolex supplied to the Bloodhound SSC land speed record attempt.

                            The Yacht-Master was originally introduced by Rolex in 1992—the first all-new model from the brand since the Daytona in 1964. The watch was designed for adventurers and sportsmen, like the topside equivalent of the diver's Submariner, to which it bears certain similarities. This version updates the classic model with extraordinary new materials. The bezel is black ceramic, the case is glorious 'Everose' gold (a unique Rolex alloy), and perhaps most exciting of all, the strap is made of rubber—a major first for Rolex—that the brand is calling 'Oysterflex'. In fact, it's not natural rubber but a special material known as elastomer. Inside, you'll find the stunning calibre 3135.

                            This watch is not just a classic Submariner—one of the most popular and iconic watches in the world—but a striking and highly collectible variant edition. The watch is easily recognisable thanks to its rare green bezel and dial, causing collectors to give it the affectionate nickname “Hulk”, although LV itself stands for Lunette Vert (“Green Bezel”). This larger version updates the previous LV model ref 16610 (called “Kermit”) that was originally introduced in 2003 for the 50th anniversary of the Submariner. This edition boasts ceramic inserts in the bezel, with numerals in platinum.

                            The Daytona features on the must-have list of pretty much every watch enthusiast out there, and what better way is there to enjoy the clean lines and classic design of this Rolex icon than with the added warmth that gold brings? Not only that, but this is one of the last Daytonas to feature the modified Zenith El Primero movement, Calibre 4030 (distinguished by the seconds hand at 9 o'clock rather than 6). This movement is proving to be very popular with collectors and is holding its value well.

                            The Rolex Daytona, named after the race circuit in Florida that hosts the Rolex twenty-four hour race, epitomises the ultimate driver’s watch. The dial, unburdened by a date window, is clear and easy to read. The tachymeter offers quick speed calculations, while the shape is instantly recognisable and supremely comfortable. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit. Here available in steel with a stunning Cerachrom bezel, this watch represents the Daytona's first major upgrade in 16 years, but it sticks closely to the gorgeous retro design of the original.

                            The Cartier Tank has been a design milestone since its inception in the early 20th century. Unlike the modified pocket watches being made by other manufacturers, the Tank used a new case design—inspired by the shape of a tank—that actually incorporated the lugs into its shape, rather than adding them as an afterthought. Other iconic design elements include the blued sword hands, Roman numerals, elegant square dial and octagonal crown complete with sapphire cabochon. The Française collection adds a somewhat sportier, more modern feel to an already superb timepiece, making it bolder and more versatile, in large part thanks to its chain-link bracelet.
