                            This vintage-looking Seamaster 300 is a 60th Anniversary tribute to one of three classic timepieces released in 1957. Like all three watches in the trilogy, it is cased in brushed and polished stainless steel and features a beautiful black 'tropical' dial, with deepened dagger indexes filled with aged-looking Super-LumiNova, enhancing the retro aesthetic. The arrow hour hand is also delightfully retro, and is something shared by Omega’s collectible Ranchero model. It also bears an engraving of the 1957 Seahorse on the caseback. Limited to just 3,557 pieces, it is powered by the self-winding Master Chronometer 8806, featuring the lubricant-free co-axial escapement invented by the illustrious English horologist George Daniels. The power reserve is 55 hours and it is water-resistant to 200 metres.

                            A superb diving watch, TAG Heuer's Aquaracer was first launched in 2004 as an evolution of the equally superb Heuer 2000 divers conceived by Jack Heuer in the 1980s. The series was devoted to professionals and adventurers, as well as water-sportsmen of all kinds, and particularly sailors and yachtsmen. The watches have improved and evolved over the years, leading to a range of magnificent models like the one for sale here, with its unidirectional bezel, exceptionally legible design and superb finishing and craftsmanship. The piece maintains an excellent 300 meter water resistance, protecting the TAG Heuer Calibre 5 inside.

                            When Patek Philippe released the Aquanaut in 1997 it was considered part of the Gerald Genta-designed Nautilus collection and shared some of its famous design elements, including the rounded octagonal bezel that drew inspiration from a porthole. It was also the first Patek Philippe to come on a rubber strap. Having branched off from the Nautilus family and gone its own way, it’s now a popular watch within the brand’s catalogue and is perhaps its sportiest model, combining a dynamic and compact design with casual elegance. This flyback chronograph model is the first of its kind in white gold and pairs a gradient blue ‘grenade’ pattern dial with midnight-blue rubber strap. The sub-dial at 6 o’clock comprises the 60-minute counter and there’s a date aperture at 3 o’clock. It runs on the automatic Caliber CH 28-520 S C which holds a power reserve of up to 45 hours and is visible through the case back, revealing the 21k gold rotor engraved with the brand’s Calatrava cross. This is a versatile luxury sports watch that has seen its demand soar in recent years.

                            Created by Gerald Genta—and like many of his famous watches—the Nautilus is a horological legend. By far Patek Philippe's best known and most desirable sports watch, it's renowned for some of the best examples of emblematic Genta trademarks, large, angular bezel, comparatively thin case, integrated bracelet and bold, if simple, dial. The design is based on the traditional shape of portholes, up to and including the hinges often found on the sides—hence the Nautilus' unmistakable “ears”. This new example is particularly interesting for its unusual white dial that uses strong black borders on the hands and indexes to maintain the high contrast legibility we're used to, while adding a sporty new flavour.

                            Named after the speedway track in Florida that hosts a legendary, Rolex-sponsored twenty-four hour race, the Daytona is the quintessential driver’s watch and was given a boost in popularity when Hollywood icon Paul Newman wore an early version of it. The dial, with its three subdials, is clear and easy to read while a tachymeter on the bezel offers quick speed calculations. It’s powered by Rolex’s Caliber 4130 automatic chronograph movement which holds a power reserve of 72 hours. Introduced in 1963 it’s been in continuous production ever since, although this particular reference is discontinued. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit.

                            The Luminor 127 is a unique and very special watch in the Panerai pantheon, one close to the hearts of many collectors and affectionately nicknamed the “Fiddy”. First released in 2002, it is an uncanny recreation of a gorgeous vintage timepiece from 1950 (hence the limited edition number), and is known for many important features. For a start, it is 47mm in diameter, a large size with which the brand would subsequently become associated (some claim that Panerai were the ones who launched the whole oversize trend). Then there's the unique form of sandwich dial, rarely seen before, which combined with the crown guard and domed sapphire crystal to create an extremely cool aura of vintage Italian style—one that few others have achieved.

                            This beautiful dress watch from Jaeger-LeCoultre is not just exceptionally well-designed, with a clean, easily readable face and gorgeous case proportions, it also represents phenomenal value for money on its movement, which features several intricate complications. The watch, released in 2014 and inspired by a vintage 1945 piece from the JLC archives, has a moonphase and a complete calendar with displays for date, day of the week, and month. With all this, it still manages to maintain a refined, minimalist aesthetic based around a highly uncluttered dial—in large part thanks to the uncommon pointer-type date display around the dial's circumference.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with high quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This recent addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage while daring to forge its own path, boasting an energetic modern design with classic racing-red highlights, along with superb finishing and the excellent calibre 16 inside.
