                            Since 1946, British aerospace company Martin-Baker has saved the lives of at least 7,450 pilots. That's because it makes ejection seats—one of the most vital pieces of safety equipment on any high-speed aircraft. Martin-Baker seats are the best of the best, tested to the most punishing levels of endurance and extremes of shock, vibration, temperature and more. Amazingly, Bremont's Martin-Baker watches have been put through the same rigours used on the ejection seats, at the same test facility. Fitted with anti-shock movement mounts and Faraday cages, the MB watches are made to be the ultimate endurance chronometer, able to survive just about anything short of a direct meteor strike. They're also not half handsome to look at.

                            The U-2 is one of the most important high tech spy planes in the US Airforce. Nicknamed the Dragon Lady, early versions of the U-2 were in operation at the beginning of the Cold War, and continue to be flown by exceptional pilots based in Beale, California. Needless to say, this is the type of aviation history that Bremont adores. The U-2 collection is a sincerely heartfelt tribute to these amazing machines and the brave souls who fly them, often over 80,000 feet into the stratosphere for 12 hours or more at a time. The beautifully designed U-2 watches have, like the plane, been tested at even higher altitudes, as well as at temperature extremes of -40ºC or more, including tests “in the field” with the U-2 pilots themselves. The watch's ultra-durable Trip-Tick case contains an inner bezel operated by a crown at 4 o'clock and comes with a DLC coating.
