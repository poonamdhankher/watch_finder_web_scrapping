                            Rolex has long been popular among women who know their horology. Unlike some brands that relegate ladies' watches to mere fashion statements, Rolex gives just as much care and attention to their mechanical credentials as it does for watches aimed at men. The Lady Datejust participates in the same legendary horological history of Rolex's groundbreaking introduction of the date window in 1945, and still bears the famous 'Superlative Chronometer Officially Certified' on the dial. Its slimmed-down size allows for stunning elegance and attention to detail, and this model is equipped with the superb calibre 2235 self-winding movement.

                            Named after the speedway track in Florida that hosts a legendary, Rolex-sponsored twenty-four hour race, the Daytona is the quintessential driver’s watch and was given a boost in popularity when Hollywood icon Paul Newman wore an early version of it. The dial, with its three subdials, is clear and easy to read while a tachymeter on the bezel offers quick speed calculations. It’s powered by Rolex’s Caliber 4130 automatic chronograph movement which holds a power reserve of 72 hours. Introduced in 1963 it’s been in continuous production ever since, although this particular reference is discontinued. Its smaller size and smart design makes it a versatile watch capable of working well with both casual jeans and a formal suit.

                            In 2008, Rolex released the Day-Date II, a modern update of the timelessly classic Day-Date, which features a larger case (41mm) than the original. This in turn was replaced in 2015 by the Day-Date 40 which, as the name implies, comes in a 40mm case. This version in white gold features the signature fluted bezel, within which is a silver dial bearing baguette diamond indices. The date at 3 o’clock lies beneath the signature Rolex Cyclops magnifying lens for better legibility. It comes on a President bracelet and runs on the Caliber 3255 automatic movement. Famously, the Day-Date was the first watch to indicate the day of the week spelt out in full when it was launched in 1956, and it has gone on to be worn by everyone from the Dalai Lama to numerous US presidents, hence it’s ‘President’ nickname.

                            In watch form, the Carrera has been in existence since 1964, when it continued Heuer’s great legacy in providing racing drivers with high quality timing instruments. Named after the intense ‘Carrera Panamericana’ road race of the 1950s (which also gave its name to the eponymous Porsche), the Carrera continues to provide timing for some of the world’s most prestigious racing teams today. This addition to the Carrera fold fully embodies that racing heritage while daring to forge its own path, boasting an energetic modern design with classic racing-red highlights.

                            Nicolas Rieussec was the first collection launched by Montblanc after the company took control of the prestigious Minerva manufacture in Villeret. The watches are named after the French inventor of the chronograph, which was originally a device that measured intervals by moving a pen in contact with rotating paper, drawing an arc as it went (hence the name chronograph, from the Greek for “time-writing”). The Nicolas Rieussec watches were also the first to house an in-house Montblanc movement, propelling the brand into the upper echelons of haute horlogerie. Matching tradition with innovation, this stunning watch is a monopusher column-wheel chrono, with a second timezone on the main dial paired with a day/night indicator that mirrors the date window.

                            Added to the beloved Aquatimer collection just last year, this new watch represents a significant step forward for IWC's divers in a number of respects. First and foremost, the watch has been widely acclaimed for its innovative external/internal bezel. Using a special clutch system positioned to look like a left hand crown, the bezel is set by unidirectional rotation as normal, in a manner that combines the ease of outer bezels with the safety advantages of inner ones. Then there's the water resistance—the watch can cope with pressures up to 30 bar, more than double its previous specs. Finally, there's the updated appearance. At 42mm, this is the smallest Aquatimer in the collection, and its black, silver and green colours are inspired by the Galapagos Islands.

                            The Rolex Explorer is one of the most highly valued and sought out models for buyers with a lot of experience in the often complicated world of vintage watch collecting. Originally based on the model worn by Tenzing Norgay in the first ever successful ascent of Everest in 1953, the Explorer was a versatile timepiece that enjoyed numerous variations. This reference 14270 is an excellent example. Starting in 1989, it brought a well-received modern upgrade to the Explorer family, while staying faithful to the original model—and also introduced the superb calibre 3000.

                            The U-2 is one of the most important high-tech spy planes in the US Airforce. Nicknamed the Dragon Lady, early versions of the U-2 were in operation at the beginning of the Cold War, and continue to be flown by exceptional pilots based in Beale, California. Needless to say, this is the type of aviation history that Bremont adores. The U-2 collection is a sincerely heartfelt tribute to these amazing machines and the brave souls who fly them, often over 80,000 feet into the stratosphere for 12 hours or more at a time. The beautifully designed U-2 watches have, like the plane, been tested at even higher altitudes, as well as at temperature extremes of -40ºC or more—including tests “in the field” with the U-2 pilots themselves. The watch's ultra-durable Trip-Tick case contains an inner bezel operated by a crown at 4 o'clock.
