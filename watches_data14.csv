                            One of the oldest watchmakers in the world—only Blancpain has been around longer, at just three years more—Jaquet Droz has produced some remarkable creations. In its early years, the watchmaker extended its craft outside of horology when founder Pierre Jaquet-Droz created three automatas—a kind of mechanical puppet—which dazzled audiences at the time. Aside from the animatronics, Jaquet Droz has created this Grande Seconde Email Ivoire. Inside, this watch is powered by the Frederic Piguet calibre 1150—a world-class movement also used by both Blancpain and Breguet. Flaunting a minimalistic aesthetic with a cream enamel dial created using the painstaking Grand Feu process—baking fine enamel powder onto a copper blank at almost one thousand degrees Celsius—this is a process at which Jaquet Droz are industry leaders. The watch also features a large sub-seconds dial, as well as hours and minutes dial. This is a unique piece from an incredibly charming watchmaker.

                            In 2014, when Jaguar announced it was making the six “remaining” Lightweight versions of the iconic E-Type (the gorgeous 60s model described as the most beautiful car ever made), it partnered with another British high-end brand, Bremont, to release six very special accompanying timepieces. Due to popular demand, these watches have since gone into production and the Jaguar has become a beloved member of the Bremont stable. Its success stems from its stunning use of E-Type design codes, from the Dunlop tyre tread on the crown to the Jaguar heritage logo, to the tachometer-inspired dial design with the same font and “red line quadrant” as the original cars.

                            “A true collaboration in research and development”, this watch hails from an exceptional collection that represents a groundbreaking partnership between aerospace giant Boeing and British horological brand-of-the-hour, Bremont. These timepieces use the most cutting-edge materials from Boeing's state-of-the-art facilities, although Bremont is keen to stress that in spirit they pay homage to an earlier chapter of the company's aircraft-building history. This exceptionally rare GMT limited edition, boasting an advanced aerospace-grade titanium case, was made exclusively for Royal Navy crew members who operate a Merlin helicopter—an image of which can be seen on the dial.
